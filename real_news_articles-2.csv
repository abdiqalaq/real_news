Duale suspends Nursing Council CEO Lister Onsongo over regulations breach,"Health Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale during a press briefing at Afya House, Nairobi, on April 25, 2025. [Benard Orwongo, Standard]

Health Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale has suspended Dr. Lister Onsongo, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nursing Council of Kenya, for breach of regulations.

In a statement on Monday, the CS made the move after uncovering a serious breach of regulations involving the Nursing Council of Kenya (NCK) and Ten Public and Private Universities.

“In line with this, the Ministry has suspended Dr. Lister Onsongo, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nursing Council of Kenya, pending the outcome of a comprehensive internal audit of the full cohort of 2,098 BSc Nursing interns. Consequently, I have appointed Ms. Ann Mukuna, Director Standards and Compliance, to take over the operations of the Council until further notice,” stated Duale.

Onsongo's termination involves allegations of unlawfully submitting 42 Bachelor of Science (BSc) Nursing students for internship before they had completed their academic programmes.

“Consequently, the Ministry has revoked all internship letters issued to the affected 42 students with immediate effect. These individuals have been immediately instructed to vacate their duty stations as investigations commence,” he added.

According to the Ministry, the action is in direct contravention of the Nursing Council Act and the guidelines approved by the Public Service Commission (PSC).

The Ministry has expressed commitment to upholding the integrity of healthcare training and deployment.

Duale further assured that all individuals found culpable—whether at the Ministry, the NCK, or within the leadership of the implicated universities—will be held fully accountable.

The Ministry is committed to safeguarding professional standards, ensuring compliance with statutory requirements, and protecting the rights of nursing graduates and the public.",https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001524876/duale-suspends-nursing-council-ceo-lister-onsongo-over-regulations-breach,real
Caf expect flood of football fans in Kenya for CHAN,"NAIROBI, Kenya, July 21, 2025 – Confederation of African Football (Caf) secretary general Veron Mosengo-Omba expects a record attendance at next month’s African Nations Championships (CHAN) in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.

Mosengo-Omba says anticipation in the rest of the continent is fever-pitch as the countdown to the competition continues.

“On my way from the airport, we could see that it is all about Pamoja CHAN. The marketing is really good and people from all over Africa are now looking to the tournament. They can’t wait to buy the tickets so they can come and watch the matches,” Mosengo-Omba said.

The secretary general further praised three countries for the exemplary preparation for the tourney, noting that it is a learning experience for co-hosts of future competitions.

“I would say it is not only about one country but the three countries…the Pamoja bid. They have done very well and there’s a lot we are learning on how three countries in the continent can co-host a tournament of such magnitude,” he said.

Mosengo-Omba was speaking during a day-long tour of the Kasarani and Nyayo stadia, which are set to host the Group A matches as well as the Group C fixture between Niger and Algeria — in the case of Nyayo.

The secretary general said it is all systems go, giving a thumbs up for the two venues.

“We are ready…you can see even the grass is in top condition as well as changing rooms. Everything is ready. There are of course, a few things remaining here and there but overall, we are ready for CHAN,” he said.

He called on all Kenyans to turn up at the stadia to support not only the home team but also the other nations who will be playing in the country.

The competition is set for kick off on August 2 at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam where Tanzania face Burkina Faso.

Retail investors win big as Nairobi bourse drops 100 minimum shares,"From left: Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) CEO Frank Mwiti, NSE EmpowerHER Lead Demi Murila, Chief of Staff in the Office of the First Lady Mary Muinde and NSE Chairman Kiprono Kittony ring the bell to launch the NSE EmpowerHER Patron’s Circle in May 2025. [Jenipher Wachie, Standard]

Retail investors at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) will, from August 1, be able to buy and sell shares in multiples of one as the market does away with the old rule that required investors to buy shares in lots of 100.

This is after the bourse received approval from the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) to amend the Equity Trading Rules, which restricted trading to 100 shares.

The new rule permits investors to trade shares up to a single unit. It seeks to draw more retail investors into the market.

Buying shares in blocks of 100 has, in the past, been cited as an entry barrier for many Kenyans. It has also kept many retail investors away from high-value stocks.

Head of Technical Services at the Kenya Association of Stockbrokers and Investment Banks (Kasib) Leah Maina said trading in smaller quantities could increase trading interest among retail investors.

“The amendment allows for trading of securities in multiples of one share. As a result, the Odd Lot Board currently used for trading smaller quantities will be phased out,” she said.

“This change supports the NSE strategic plan, which focuses on revitalising the market through greater retail participation.”

NSE said the amendment allows for the trading of stocks in multiples of one share. “We listened carefully to feedback from our investors and stakeholders, especially on the need to make our stock market more accessible, inclusive and responsive to the realities of retail investors,” said NSE Chief Executive Frank Mwiti.

“The approval of single-share trading marks a significant milestone in democratising access to the capital markets. By phasing out the Odd Lot Board and allowing trading in multiples of just one share, we are removing barriers to entry and enabling every Kenyan — regardless of income level — to invest, build wealth and participate in the growth of our economy.”

NSE expects the move to deepen liquidity, adding that it directly supports the NSE 2025–2029 Strategic Plan.

The strategic plan looks to grow retail investors at NSE to nine million by 2029, an audacious target for a market that has about 1.6 million, but only less than 40,000 are active. Nine million investors would also mean about a third of Kenya’s working population participating in the market.

NSE also plans to list an additional 40 companies on the market as it seeks to expand investment opportunities.

The market is currently riding on a wave of resurgence after a multi-year period characterised by a lull. Last year, the NSE emerged as the best-performing market in Africa in dollar terms according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International Frontier Markets Index.

The momentum has carried into 2025, with the market’s key performance indicators showing continued growth. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, all major NSE benchmark indices posted double-digit growth, according to data by NSE. The NSE All Share Index, which tracks the performance of all listed companies, climbed by 22.41 per cent.

The NSE 20 Share Index rose by 18.54 per cent, while the NSE 10 Share Index and NSE 25 Share Index gained 14.28 per cent and 13.89 per cent, respectively.",https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/business/article/2001524805/retail-investors-win-big-as-nairobi-bourse-drops-100-minimum-shares,real
Kenya bans export of raw macadamia nuts,"The Agriculture and food Authority (AFA) [Courtesy]

The Agriculture and food Authority (AFA) has announced plans to ban on exports and transit of raw macadamia nuts through Kenyan ports.

According to the authority the move is aimed at protecting local farmers and promoting domestic processing.

Dr. Bruno Linyiru, AFA Director General, made the announcement on Friday, 18 July, noting that the ban applies to all raw macadamia nuts, both in-shell and unprocessed, whether wet or dry, regardless of their country of origin.

“Exporters from foreign states intending to trade in raw macadamia are advised to use alternative foreign ports of exit and to refrain from routing raw macadamia produce through Kenya,” Linyiru warned

The directive follows multiple interceptions of macadamia consignments at Kenyan border points in recent weeks.

The AFA in the statement said the move is part of the enforcement of the Crops Act, 2013, and the Crops (Nuts and Oil Crops) Regulations, 2020, which prohibit the export of raw nuts in a bid to encourage local value addition.

“No raw macadamia nuts may be exported through or from Kenya,” Linyiru emphasized, noting that the measure is aimed at safeguarding the local processing industry and promoting industrial development.",https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/business/article/2001524644/kenya-bans-export-of-raw-macadamia-nuts,real

Kenya protests: 31 die in highest one-day death toll of year – DW – 07/08/2025,"The death toll from anti-government protests in Kenya surged to 31, which is the highest one-day death toll since protests began this year. The protests this year were fueled by a blogger's death in police custody.

The death toll from Kenya's anti-government protests on Monday has surged to 31, marking the highest single-day toll since demonstrations began earlier this year, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.

The report on Tuesday said another 107 people were injured and more than 500 were arrested amid widespread destruction of property, including supermarkets.

The figure did not include specifics and it was not clear whether the toll included police officers, who the report accused of working with armed gangs in the wake of violence.

Kenyans demanding better governance and removal of president

Kenyans have been protesting for weeks to call for better governance and police accountability, as well as demanding the removal of President William Ruto over alleged corruption.

Kenyans yesterday took to the streets to demand political reforms on a day — July 7 — that has significance in history because of major pro-democracy protests that took place on the same date thirty-five years ago.

The East African nation transitioned into a multiparty democracy from a one-party state with elections in 1992.

During protests yesterday, police blocked access to central Nairobi so people couldn't rally in the city center, as they had done before.

Young Kenyans last year had briefly stormed the parliament in Nairobi during protests over planned tax hikes, which were ultimately withdrawn.

Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, on Tuesday urged that grievances leading to the protests be addressed, with his spokesperson saying Turk ""renews his call for calm and restraint, and full respect for the freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly.""

Marathon world record holder suspended after doping test – DW – 07,"Kenya's Ruth Chepngetich, who won last year's Chicago marathon in record time, has been provisionally suspended after testing positive for the banned substance hydrochlorothiazide.

Marathon world record holder Ruth Chepngetich has been provisionally suspended on suspicion of doping, World Athletics' independent Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) said on Thursday.

The 30-year-old Kenyan smashed the women's marathon world record in Chicago in October last year with an astonishing time of 2:09:56 – almost two minutes faster than the previous record held by Ethiopia's Tigist Assefa (2:11:53).

On March 14 this year, however, she tested positive for the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is banned because it can be used to hide traces of other banned substances. It can also be used to treat fluid retention and hypertension.

According to the AIU, Chepngetich was informed of the positive test on April 16 and agreed on a voluntary suspension three days later.

Chepngetich withdrew from London marathon

""When there is a positive test for diuretics and masking agents, a provisional suspension is not mandatory under the World Anti-Doping Code,"" explained AIU chief Brett Clothier.

""Chepngetich was not provisionally suspended by the AIU at the time of notification. However, on 19 April she opted for a voluntary provisional suspension while the AIU's investigation was ongoing.

""In the intervening months, the AIU continued its investigation and today issued a Notice of Charge and imposed its own provisional suspension.""

In April, Chepngetich withdrew from the London Marathon, saying she was ""not in the right place mentally or physically to race my best.""

The AIU emphasized that Chepngetich has the right to have her case heard by a disciplinary tribunal.

Chepngetich is not the first Kenyan runner to be banned in recent years, with former men's half-marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie and two-time Frankfurt men's marathon winner Brimin Misoi Kipkorir also coming to the attention of anti-doping authorities.

Kenya's Gen Z protestors face trauma amid ongoing rallies – DW – 07,"As Kenya's youth keep pushing for political and social change, they risk paying a steep personal price. Deadly clashes with police, emotional trauma and anxiety have become their new realities.

On June 25, Wendy, a young Kenyan woman, joined hundreds of demonstrators in Nairobi to protest the death of Albert Ojwang, a 31-year-old blogger and teacher who had just recently died in police custody. It was a bold decision on her part, one that came with much fear and uncertainty amid a growing government crackdown on dissent.

""Initially, I wasn't going to show up because I was a little bit scared. They said they were targeting women this time,"" Wendy told DW.

In the end, she returned home safely. But others didn't.

At least 19 people were killed nationwide during the protests held on that day, which coincided with the first anniversary of last year's storming of Kenya's parliament.

'I don't know whether I'll come back home'

Driven by widespread frustration over police brutality, economic hardship, and what many see as a failing government under President William Ruto, these demonstrations, which are largely led by young opposition voices who self-identify as Gen Z, have become a defining feature of the political landscape of Kenya.

But showing resistance can also take a toll on mental health. ""I am completely terrified most of the time when I'm getting out of the house to go for the protests,"" Wendy explained, highlighting a growing sense of anxiety among young people in the country.

Alex Mutua, another young protester, described the fear that now accompanies every demonstration and political rally, saying that ""Every time I go out to fight for my country, I don't know if I'll be targeted by the police.""

""Going out and being part of that protest has been a really scary ordeal, considering how the police are handling the protests,"" he added.

Irene Mwari, a university student and regular protester in Nairobi, agreed that the emotional price that young people have to pay keeps growing.

""Once I go to a protest in Kenya, I don't really know whether I'll come back home,"" Mwari told DW.

Yet she feels driven by a desire to speak out against what she calls poor governance, even though each protest can become a gamble with her life.

Despite promising her parents that she would stay away from future demonstrations, Mwari admitted she has no intention of keeping her word.

""At the end of the day, we are the ones who have to live in Kenya with such bad governance. So, if we don't fight for a better future, I don't know who will.""

Violence and fear

The protests have grown increasingly dangerous over time. Kenya's National Commission on Human Rights reported that 31 people were killed during the July 7 ""Saba Saba” protests alone — making this the deadliest single day of rallies this year.

More than 100 were injured and 500 arrested; countless supermarkets and other businesses were looted or destroyed.

The commission has accused police of using live ammunition and collaborating with armed gangs to suppress these protests. Mwari agreed.

""If you're lucky enough you escape being shot. The government has used guns to disrupt peaceful protests. If they don't beat you up, you'll get robbed in broad daylight.""

The Psychological toll

Mental health professionals in Kenya also stress that the protests are no longer just a political matter — they've become deeply personal and therefore are emotionally draining for many.

""We are experiencing collective trauma,"" said Kenyan psychologist Benta Wambui.

""Many young protesters are experiencing chronic stress and anxiety because of repeated exposure to violence. There is also emotional exhaustion, and sometimes there can be burnout and a growing sense of hopelessness,"" she added, underscoring the fact that the prolonged nature of the standoff between civilians and authorities, now lasting well over a year, can make such symptoms worse.

Geoffrey Mboya, a youth activist and community organizer, has been on the frontlines of the demonstrations from the beginning, initially getting involved in opposition movements two years ago already.

He said the emotional toll has changed him permanently: ""[The protests have] affected me in ways that I don't think I'll ever fully be able to articulate,"" he told DW.

""I have lost part of myself.""

A deep desire to see change

Wambui noted that even those who are not physically present at protests are affected by the overall mood.

""There's also the weight of trauma and loss on Kenyans as a collective. So, we witnessed state brutality, people losing peers, and people losing family. Whether you knew these people or not, this can trigger grief and other PTSD symptoms as well as emotional numbness,"" she explained.

But despite the trauma, many young Kenyans say they won't stop protesting.

""Having faith that the protests will bring change is what keeps me going,"" said Mutua, a sentiment echoed also by Wendy. ""I really want a country that works, a country that works for me and my daughter,"" she said.

However, she also admitted that she's emotionally drained. ""Some days I feel so defeated. Sometimes even feel almost useless.""

Mboya meanwhile said he is fighting two battles at the same time: one against the government, and one with himself.

""The revolution needs a whole lot of people to be a support system. We need healing to fight well,"" he told DW, sharing that he has started going to therapy to address the traumatic experiences he has witnessed.

""Therapy doesn't make the pain go away, but it helps you carry it,"" he explained.

The need for healing

Wambui agreed that finding emotional support is essential for protesters to be able to continue their fight in a healthy manner. ""Grief spaces can be held where people can collectively process their trauma together and have peer support systems, where people can come together and talk about the things that are ongoing, whether that's virtual or in-person,"" she said.

She also called for broader mental health education.

""It's also important to have mental health literacy amongst the population for them to be able to recognize triggers, to recognize burnout, to recognize all these things, and to be able to get the help that they need.""

“Every parent, including me, I take time to parent my children — and so must everybody,” President Ruto said. “The police are trained to deal with criminals. They are not trained in parenting.”

“Let us not use, misuse or abuse our children by inciting them to cause violence or destroy property. Asiye funzwa na mzazi wake hufunzwa na...” he said, trailing off in a proverb suggesting that discipline deferred by parents ends up being enforced by society.

He went further, urging families not to “misuse” children by allowing them to participate in violent protests.The President’s remarks mark a continuation of a broader pattern in which he has assigned blame to various entities for the sustained unrest that began last year.

Harvard and Trump lawyers clash in court over funding fight,"Harvard and Trump lawyers clash in court over funding fight

Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration have sparred in a Boston courtroom as they fought over President Donald Trump's decision to strip billions of dollars in government funding for Harvard's education programmes. In a hearing on Monday, the judge overseeing the case seemed sceptical of the move to freeze more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in federal grants for the university in a stated effort to fight antisemitism. Judge Allison Burroughs questioned how denying money allocated for medical research would stop antisemitism. At one point she called the government's claims ""mind-boggling"". Lawyers for Trump argued that the cuts are deserved and necessary to punish anti-Jewish bias.

The closely watched case comes as the White House also moves to prevent the university from accessing a visa system that allows it to enrol foreign students. Judge Burroughs, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, has already made several interim rulings in favour of Harvard in a separate lawsuit over the foreign student visa system. In the funding battle, Harvard has asked the judge to reach a decision by 3 September - the deadline the Trump administration has given the university to wind up its financial obligations with regards to federal grants. Any ruling in the case is likely to be appealed and could end up before the US Supreme Court. During the packed courtroom hearing, Harvard lawyer Steven Lehotsky argued that the administration was trying to control the ""inner workings"" of the institution. ""The administration has given no consideration to patients, the public at large and the harm of all this research being cut off,"" said Mr Lehotsky, noting that Harvard has a research relationship with the US that stretches back over eight decades. He added that there is no evidence that the cuts - which affect research into everything from medicine to space travel to artificial intelligence - will have any impact on antisemitism on campus. A lawyer for the government, Michael Velchik, said that the university had violated an executive order signed by Trump directed at combating antisemitism. ""Harvard wants billions of dollars and that is the only reason we are here,"" said Mr Velchik, who graduated from Harvard in 2012. He said the Trump administration was right to cancel the grants because ""Harvard prioritised campus protesters over cancer research"". His comments were a reference to anti-Israel protests seen at America's oldest university, which also took place on campuses across the US. Judge Burroughs questioned how the government had determined whether Harvard administrators ""have taken enough steps or haven't"" to combat antisemitism. She noted that government lawyers had provided ""no documentation, no procedure"" to ""suss out"" their claims.

Reuters Protesters outside the courthouse denounced the funding cuts

She also questioned whether the government believed it could cancel the allocated funds without providing proof of antisemitism. ""The consequences of that in terms of constitutional law are staggering,"" the judge said, also calling the assertion ""mind-boggling"". ""Don't you have to show each researcher is antisemitic, instead of a blanket statement: Harvard is antisemitic?"" she asked. The judge declined to issue an instant summary judgement after the nearly three-hour hearing, and promised to issue a ruling soon. Trump, in a post on Truth Social, argued that the judge is biased, and ""a total disaster"". He predicted that she would rule against the government, and vowed to ""immediately appeal, and win"". Dozens of protesters assembled outside the court during the hearing, holding signs reading ""defend academic freedom"" and ""hands off Harvard"". Trump has previously suggested that his actions against Harvard are part of a negotiating strategy, at one point saying ""I think we're probably going to settle with Harvard"". In a statement, a White House spokesman said: ""We are confident that Harvard will eventually come around and support the president's vision, and through good-faith conversations and negotiations, a good deal is more than possible.""

The organisation that represents rank-and-file police officers has expressed concerns about excessive working hours during President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland later this week. The Scottish Police Federation (SPF) said workforce agreements - designed to protect officers and provide minimum health and safety - have been breached. The federation is now seeking advice over the possibility of legal action against Police Scotland. Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond said: ""We are working closely with the Scottish Police Federation to address any concerns they may have.""

David Kennedy, general secretary of the SPF, earlier said there were concerns over how many days in a row officers would have to work and notice periods. He told BBC Scotland News his members were governed by workforce agreements as opposed to employment law. Mr Kennedy said: ""There are breaches taking place within those workforce agreements which we are really deeply concerned about. ""We are now having to seek whether or not we are going to have to take action against the service because of it."" He added some officers were currently scheduled to work ""12 hour plus days"" and as many as 10 days in a row. The SPF general secretary added that a police officer couple, who are due to get married in the north east this weekend, were still waiting to get an excusal although he expected the matter to be resolved.

President Trump will visit Turnberry and Aberdeen, where he has golf resorts, on his trip between 25 and 29 July. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the US president would meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. President Trump is also scheduled to meet First Minister John Swinney. The upcoming visit will be the Trump's first trip to Scotland since 2023, when he broke ground on a new 18-hole golf course dedicated to his Isle of Lewis-born mother Mary at his resort in Menie, Aberdeenshire. It is unclear whether Trump will visit the course, which has since been renamed the ""New Course,"" during his stay. The president has owned Trump Turnberry in South Ayrshire since 2014.

Ms Leavitt told a press briefing in Washington DC the meeting with Starmer – due to take place in Aberdeen – would ""refine the great trade deal that was brokered between the United States and the United Kingdom."" She made no mention of the scheduled meeting with Swinney, which the Scottish government previously said would be ""an opportunity to promote the interests of Scotland"". Police Scotland confirmed it was preparing for a presidential visit earlier this month. The Scottish government said it had been working with the national force to put plans in place, with thousands of officers likely to be deployed as part of the security operation.

Three men have been arrested over alleged terrorism offences in Edinburgh after being accused of displaying signs showing support for a proscribed organisation. Police Scotland said a 58-year-old man was arrested near the Scottish Parliament on Monday afternoon. The force said two men, aged 78 and 60, were also charged with the same offence at a protest in Edinburgh on Saturday. In recent days more than 100 people protesting the decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terror group have been arrested across the UK.

The arrests in Edinburgh were confirmed as three women appeared in court charged with terrorism offences after a van was driven into the fence of a defence factory in the capital. The suspects were arrested following the incident at Leonardo UK's facility on Crewe Road North on Tuesday. Allegra Fitzherbert, 34, Susan Riddell, 42, and Naomi Stubbs-Gorman, 31, were all charged with malicious mischief which was ""aggravated by reason of having a terrorist connection"". Ms Riddell was also charged with an offence under the Road Traffic Act 1988 which was ""aggravated by reason of having a terrorist connection"". Ms Fitzherbert, of London, and Ms Riddell, of Glasgow, made no plea, were committed for further examination and granted bail. Ms Stubbs-Gorman, of Glasgow, also made no plea but her application for bail was continued and she is due to appear again on Tuesday.

Airport drivers try to beat drop-off charges by parking in laybys,"Parked in lay-bys - the drivers determined to avoid airport drop-off fees

2 days ago Share Save James Delaney BBC Scotland News Share Save

BBC Caroline O'Brien parked in a lay-by near the main terminal building to avoid paying the charge

It's a hot and sticky Friday in the middle of the summer holidays and cars are flooding onto Edinburgh Airport's approach road. There are few places to stop, but in almost every lay-by a steady stream of drivers await friends and loved ones touching down from their holidays. They are all parked in a half-mile radius from the entrance to the terminal building in a bid to beat so-called ""kiss-and-fly"" charges in the official drop-off zone. Research by the RAC, released this week, found that more than half of the country's busiest airports have raised drop-off fees in the last 12 months.

In Edinburgh, drivers face a £6 tariff for a 10-minute stay at a specific drop-off and pick-up zone metres from the main terminal building. Every minute beyond that allowance will cost them an extra £1. Meanwhile, Edinburgh Airport's short-stay terminal car park costs £7 for up to 15 minutes wait time and £14 for 30 minutes. Other short-stay car parks further from the terminal largely cost between £7 and £10, significantly increasing in cost beyond an hour, while some are free for a limited period.

A lay-by near a roundabout at Edinburgh Airport was almost full

Instead, drivers here look to beat the system, waiting in nooks and crannies along Eastfield Road for a message that their passengers have arrived. They then drive a few hundred metres towards the Moxy or Hilton hotels and pick them up as they leave the airport complex, exiting hastily to avoid risking a fine for parking on double yellow lines.

Close to the Moxy, next to a farm gate by a grass verge, Caroline O'Brien, 52, is waiting in a lay-by for her husband and children after they returned from a holiday to Paris. She says she had previously been charged £24 for under 30 minutes in the drop-off zone and decided not to take any chances this time. ""You don't know if the plane is going to be early or late in and I don't want them to be standing around,"" she says. ""For pick-up and drop-off, I think a couple of pounds [would be fair]. You're only there a few minutes for them to get their cases and then right back in the car and away again.""

The pickup and drop-off zone at Edinburgh Airport does not inform drivers about fees on their approach

Drivers approaching via Eastfield Road pass three roundabouts on the way into the main terminal, the closest of which leads them on to a one-way system which means they have to pass through the drop-off zone. There is no signage on the approach to inform them of the charges, however there is when they are already inside the drop-off zone. Drivers pay once they exit the drop-off area.

Edinburgh Airport is among those to have increased their prices in the last year

London Gatwick, Bristol, Leeds Bradford, Southampton and Stansted charged the top rate of £7 in the RAC survey. Edinburgh is level with London Heathrow, Birmingham, Liverpool John Lennon and Glasgow in charging £6 for the initial drop off. By contrast, at nine of the 10 busiest airports in the European Union there are no drop-off fees. Rontom Tschopp, 32, from Switzerland, had just dropped a friend off at the terminal but was unaware there would be a charge for doing so.

Rontom Tschopp said there were no drop-off charges at his local airport in Switzerland

He says his local airport, in Basel, did not charge for the same service. He says: ""I was a bit flabbergasted to be honest, because we don't have that in Switzerland. ""I think it creates a form of aversion to do the little things like drop off your friends. If I had known about the fees, we probably wouldn't have had such a heartfelt goodbye, it would have been: 'No, go now, there's extra fees'.""

Sheila McPheely said the free drop-off zone was useful for some, but not those with mobility issues.

Edinburgh Airport does have other road links with the city centre through bus services, while the tram network also stops just outside. It also has a free drop-off zone about half a mile (0.8km) from the main terminal building, across the tram line and near a car rental service. Drivers can park there for 30 minutes free of charge, but it costs £10 up to an hour after that and £18 for between one and three hours. Up another side street, near a vacant commercial business, Shiela McPheely is waiting to collect her sisters from their holiday in Albufeira in Portugal. She says the cost of the drop-off zone is ""appalling"" and is planning to pick her sisters up at the free drop-off point, despite both having mobility issues. ""It's just greedy. You pay enough for your flights and when you get in there, you get a tea or a coffee, so they are getting money from you that way,"" Sheila, 79, says. ""There is a bit you can park in that is free, but that is all very well if you are young and fit, but one of my sisters has a sore back, the other one is waiting for a hip operation, so it's difficult for them.""

Gavin Marshall said the charges were ""extortionate""

Back inside the charged drop-off area, a multi-storey car park provides a roof and shade from the warm afternoon sun. Gavin Marshall, 45, has been waiting for some time for his in-laws to arrive on a flight from London, before driving them back to Stirling. He says he had not noticed the charge before he parked up. He says: ""It's a bit extortionate, £1 per minute is a bit of a joke."" ""The flat £6 I think is fair, this £1 per minute seems a bit silly, it's a bit much.""

Dean Carse said the charges made each journey £6 more expensive for customers in his taxi

Meanwhile, taxi driver Dean Carse, 31, says the charge has an impact on customers. He says: ""Every journey is £6 more expensive. ""I pay it, but I get it back off the customer, which is ridiculous, it goes from the customer to me to the airport. ""The airport spin it like they care about pollution, but they don't. They're a business and they want to make money.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd78lee2enpo,real
Would shorter summer school holidays be better?,"Should school summer holidays be shorter?

2 days ago Share Save Share Save

Tara Moore/Getty Images

Shorter school summer holidays may sound like a child's nightmare – but they could be a relief for parents who are trying to juggle childcare with their jobs. Some schools now have five-week breaks in the summer, but a two-week October half term. But is there an argument for shorter summers at all schools? Could a shorter break help with learning? Or do pupils - and teachers - need the time to recharge? Would spreading out school holidays across the year help reduce the cost of family holidays, or would smaller windows create a rush to book time off? Let's take a look at some of the issues.

Would it help parents and pupils?

Branwen Jeffreys • @branwenjeffreys Education Editor

Six weeks is a long time away from learning, especially for children whose parents are working or who can't afford lots of costly day trips, activities or a long family holiday. So while all children may forget a little of what they have learnt, families with more money can enrich their understanding by giving them other experiences, and this widens the learning gap. For many families with children, food is one of the biggest bills. During term time, more than a quarter of children across England are eligible for free school meals, and in some schools, it is closer to half of all pupils. As food costs have risen, there has been growing awareness of what is called holiday hunger, with some families struggling to feed children without school support. There are other factors too. While summer allows for playing outside, footy kickarounds and being in the garden, extending winter holidays may mean families need to heat their homes more in the daytime. England, Wales and Scotland all have six-week summer breaks, though Scotland's tends to be earlier, finishing in mid-August. In Northern Ireland, schools are closed for all of July and August. Most of England's schools are now academies who can set their own holidays, and some have already opted for five weeks in summer and two weeks in October. In Surrey, the county council has decided to follow suit for all the schools it supports from autumn 2026.

In Wales, that model was put out to consultation, attracting more than 16,000 responses from parents and teachers. It was divisive. Only a narrow majority were in favour and in June 2024, the plans were put on hold. Parentkind, the charity for parent-teacher organisations, has released polling suggesting 53% of parents would like a four-week summer holiday, rising to 60% in families with a child with special educational needs. The same polling also suggests a four-week break is much less popular with teachers, with only 24% in favour of the idea. This may ultimately be a stumbling block. It is hard to recruit teachers because for the rest of the year, they have little to no flexibility in their working patterns, unusual now for many graduate roles. Summer is when teachers recharge and also pack in their planning and lesson preparation ahead of September. However, earlier this year, the chief inspector of schools at Ofsted, Sir Martyn Oliver, said he thought shorter breaks could be beneficial. He said after the long summer holiday, some children returned ""dysregulated"" and struggling to adapt to routine.

Cheaper trips but a battle for leave?

Faarea Masud Business reporter

The price of going away during the six-week school holidays can be eye-watering. This is because the high demand from parents and those working in education for those dates means travel firms can hike prices up and still sell out. So spreading some of these weeks out across the year could provide more opportunities to go away and lessen demand at any one time, thus bringing down prices. However, if the summer holiday was only four weeks long, it could also have the opposite effect of squashing the demand into a smaller time frame and pushing up prices further. One way to mitigate this would be for different regions to stagger their school summer holidays, suggests Which? Travel editor, Rory Boland. Holiday prices would come down ""only if travel firms can restrain themselves from massively inflating prices"", he says. Any price drops could also come at the expense of those who currently avoid going away during the school summer holidays, as they might find there are fewer bargains to be had. There could also be an impact on traffic jams, airport queues and overcrowded trains if everyone isn't making a dash for it at the same time. If there was a shorter summer break, employers would have to navigate a higher number of holiday requests over a smaller period of time. For instance, three people wanting to take two weeks off each over summer could be staggered over six weeks, but over four weeks might prove more tricky. If leave isn't possible, bosses should ""carefully consider"" flexible working to help balance workload with childcare, says David D'Souza, director of profession at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).

Are hotter summers a factor?

Different countries have different holiday setups and it often comes down to weather. Hot countries like India - which has around two months of summer holiday - tend to have longer breaks, while more temperate countries often go shorter. In South Korea, the winter break is longer than the summer one, though some parents have suggested this should be evened out. Germany has a rotation system between the 16 states, though the Guardian recently reported there was a dispute due to two southern regions historically claiming what are seen as the prime slots because of their traditional harvests. The Met Office said this week that extreme weather was the new normal for the UK and with changing weather, do we need to change how we think about the summer break? According to BBC Weather forecaster Darren Bett, climate change means we are already seeing warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers - a pattern that is expected to continue. Heatwaves are expected to occur more often (there have already been three this year during exam season), but the hottest weather usually comes between July and August when the air and land has had longer to heat up. Darren says hay fever could also be an issue for pupils, particularly those sitting exams. He says a study by the University of Worcester showed oak and grass pollen seasons are starting earlier and birch pollen is becoming more severe. His conclusion is that the summer holidays should be longer and exams taken in autumn, but we're not sure how that would work.

How do kids feel about it?

Sam, Grace and Betsy have mixed views on changing the summer break

It's easy for us adults to discuss things like costs and working arrangements. But what do those who are arguably most affected think? We asked pupils at a primary school in Manchester. Sam, in year six, says he thinks we should have longer holidays ""because, in countries like Ireland and Spain, they have 9-11 weeks."" ""Lots of people are saying that our generation don't play out,"" he says, ""but I think it's the complete opposite, because if we had longer, we would definitely play out more and we wouldn't be bored because we'd plan more things."" But Betsy, also in year six, says she is concerned about what that might mean for her learning. ""I think we should keep the holidays the same because, say, if I was on a holiday for 12 weeks and you go back to school, then it might take a while to get settled into your friend group and remember everything you've learnt for the last year and get used to the whole school vibe."" Grace, in year five, says if holidays were longer she'd get a lot more bored as, ""You won't see your friends as much"". ""You'll see lots of family but you won't see as much of your friends and you could be asking when are we going back, because I'd be a little bit bored.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp82x4709n0o,real

John Chatterley Kimondo (centre) said she did not realise the impact her mayorship would have on her home country and in Dunstable

The first black mayor of a town has received a government delegation from her home country of Kenya. The official visit to Dunstable Town Council in Bedfordshire from the capital of Kenya took place on Friday, two weeks after Sally Kimondo was appointed mayor. Kimondo, 47, said it was a ""privilege"" to receive the phone call telling her the delegation would be visiting from Nairobi City County. She said: ""I am getting so many invites to go and speak at events in Kenya but my priority is the people of Dunstable.""

She said she did not realise the impact becoming mayor had made ""back home in Kenya and even in Dunstable"". Kimondo said she truly felt ""honoured"" to become the first black mayor of the town and said it ""shows that multiculturalism is being celebrated in Dunstable"".

Tony Fisher/BBC Sally Kimondo said that taking on the role of mayor was quite ""overwhelming"" and ""humbling""

Kimondo, a Labour councillor, is a social worker in children's services and has lived in Bedfordshire for more than 20 years, and in Dunstable for five years. She succeeded the first independent mayor of the town, Louise O'Riordan. At her inauguration, she said her message was ""be kind to people as you do not know what they are going through"". She thanked the people of Dunstable, as she said everyone had been very welcoming and she had not received any negative comments.

John Chatterley Among the delegates was director of youth affairs at Nairobi City County, Daniel Ngari

""This moment is not just about me; it's about every child who now sees someone who looks like them in leadership. It's about a town that chooses unity, growth, and representation,"" she explained. ""Every charity and community group plays a crucial role in making our society better."" She picked the CHUMS children's charity and Hospice at Home Volunteers as her chosen charities.

"Girl, 14, killed by lion in Kenya","Girl, 14, killed by lion in Kenya

Nairobi National Park is home to animals such as lions, buffalos, giraffes, leopards and cheetahs (stock image)

The lion has not been found but KWS said it had set a trap and deployed search teams to look for the animal.

The alarm was raised by another teenager and KWS rangers followed tracks to the nearby Mbagathi River, where they found the primary school girl's remains.

The child was snatched from a residential compound on a ranch next to Nairobi National Park, according to the conservation agency.

A 14-year-old girl has been killed by a lion on the outskirts of Nairobi, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said.

The agency added that additional security measures had been taken to prevent any further attacks.

Nairobi National Park lies just 10km (six miles) from the city centre and is home to animals such as lions, buffalos, giraffes, leopards and cheetahs.

It is fenced on three sides to stop animals roaming into the city but it is open to the south to allow animals to migrate in and out of the area.

While lions often come into conflict with humans in Kenya, especially over livestock, it is not common for people to be killed.

Last year, CCTV footage captured the moment a lion snatched a Rottweiler dog from another home near Nairobi National Park.

KWS also reported that a 54-year-old man was killed by an elephant on Saturday. The incident happened in the central Nyeri county, about 130km (80 miles) north of Nairobi.

The elephant was grazing in Mere Forest when it attacked the man, who sustained serious chest injuries, fractured ribs and internal trauma.

He was taken to a nearby hospital where he died from his injuries.

Paula Kahumbu, head of the WildlifeDirect conservation group, said the deaths were not isolated incidents and urged KWS to improve ""risk assessments and ensure accurate, real-time communication of wildlife movement and behavior, especially in known high-risk areas such as Savannah Ranch,"" where the 14-year-old was killed.

She also said that all lodges, camps, and residential developments near areas where wildlife lived should be ""equipped with anti-predator deterrent systems - including lights, alarms, secure fencing, and anti-predator sprays"".

""Prevention is our first and best line of defense,"" she added.

Kenya alarm after carrier bag mistaken for stray lion,"Kenya alarm after carrier bag mistaken for stray lion

BBC The shopping bag had been placed at the bottom of a hedge

The three armed Kenyan wildlife officers must have been on high alert as they cautiously approached a homestead following reports that a stray lion had been sighted in the area.

But that soon turned to astonishment when all they found was a shopping bag in a hedge - albeit one with a realistic image of a lion's head on it.

A farm hand in Kinyana village, just a kilometre from the Mt Kenya National park, raised the alarm after spotting what he thought was a lion just outside his employer's home.

The bag had been placed in the hedge by the home owner, who had put some avocado tree seedlings in it and wanted to stop them drying out.

Local chief Cyrus Mbijiwe told the BBC that although there had been no recent reports of stray lions in the area, residents had complained that some of their livestock had gone missing.

""We treated the incident with a lot of caution and seriousness. We first ensured everyone was safe then wildlife officials investigated and discovered that it was a bag,"" the chief said.

The homestead owner was away when the wildlife wardens were called. When she arrived back home, she was told about the lion and was advised to enter her house through the door on the opposite side of the building from the hedge, so she didn't immediately connect the report with the bag containing her seedlings.

The shopping bag was directly below a window and when it was opened, the officials realised that the supposed lion didn't have a body - and was in fact a shopping bag.

Despite the false alarm, the Kenya Wildlife Service said it it lauded ""the public for raising an alarm in order to mitigate a possible conflict"".

Is William Ruto the most disliked Kenyan president in history?,"Is William Ruto the most disliked president in Kenya's history?

Bloomberg via Getty Images William Ruto has faced mounting public resentment since he became president

Kenya's William Ruto rode into office on a wave of enthusiasm among ordinary people who hoped he would live up to his promises to improve their lives. Instead, he is facing unrelenting criticism – seen as unmatched in the country's history. Seemingly frustrated by the intensity of the backlash, he on Wednesday asked why such public outrage was never directed at his predecessors, including Daniel arap Moi, who ruled with an iron fist for over two decades marked by political repression and human rights abuses, and others who departed under clouds of controversy. On Wednesday Ruto posed: ""All this chaos, why wasn't it directed at [former presidents] Moi, Mwai Kibaki, Uhuru Kenyatta…Why the contempt and arrogance?"" Analysts describe the current wave of public anger toward President Ruto, which has seen more than 100 people killed over the past year, as ""unprecedented"", uniting Kenyans across ethnic, religious, and class divisions.

Protests against his administration began barely a year after he came into power. Three years in, many aggrieved Kenyans now want him gone – amid unrelenting protests with rallying calls of ""Ruto must go"" and ""Ruto Wantam"" (Ruto for one term). When Ruto was vying for the presidency, he portrayed himself as a common man, who came from a childhood marked by poverty and resilience. He appealed to the ordinary folk as a person they could draw inspiration from - having risen from chicken seller to president. Contrast that to earlier this year, when a newspaper splashed a headline asking whether Ruto was ""Kenya's most hated president"", a sentiment that has often echoed across social media platforms and public discourse. It marks an extraordinary change in Kenyan politics, often shaped by ethnic allegiances and class divisions. Just as Ruto was seen as transcending those barriers to clinch the presidency, the same dynamics now appear to be working against him. This week the phrase ""We are all Kikuyus,"" trended on social media as young people rejected attempts to reintroduce the ethnic divisions that have long plagued Kenyan politics. A counter narrative of ""We are all Kenyans"" emerged but failed to gain similar traction – with some seeing it as an attempt to dilute the expression of solidarity in the first message. The Kikuyu, Kenya's largest ethnic group from the Mt Kenya region, overwhelmingly backed Ruto in the 2022 elections, together with Rigathi Gachagua, who hails from the region, as his deputy. But Gachagua's hounding from office last year through a dramatic impeachment process, which he described as a betrayal, sparked discontent in the region. In the aftermath, some politicians allied to Ruto have accused Kikuyu elites of fuelling opposition against the president. Political analyst Mark Bichachi says the opposition to the president is not ethnically driven, but is happening across diverse communities in urban and rural areas. He terms the ""public outcry against a president and a regime"" both ""unprecedented"" and ""historical"", even surpassing the political upheavals of the 1980s and 1990s when Moi led a one-party state. The period was marked by brutal crackdowns and a bloody fight for multiparty democracy, but Mr Bichachi tells the BBC that this did not generate the kind of pressure now bearing down on Ruto, adding that the tensions then were linked to the Cold War and were felt across the continent.

Why the death of a blogger has put Kenya's police on trial

'Shoot in the leg' - Kenyan leader orders police to curb violent protests But academic Dr Njoki Wamai says the criticism levelled at the president is nothing unusual, but part of a political tradition during moments of crisis. ""All presidents, when they've gone against the constitution, against the will of the Kenyan people, have always faced a lot of criticism,"" she tells the BBC. She points to past leaders such as the founding president Jomo Kenyatta and his successor Moi - who both faced an intense backlash and loss of public trust during critical moments - including after the assassination of key political leaders and the coup attempt against Moi in 1982.

Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Past Kenyan presidents such Daniel arap Moi also faced an intense backlash

""What is different [this time] is that the scale of spread of information is higher,"" she says, noting the impact of Kenya's digitally savvy youth, whose widespread access to social media and digital tools has amplified public discourse. She also describes Ruto as always having been ""very conservative,"" suggesting that his political outlook clashes with the more liberal values embraced by many Kenyans - particularly young people. This ideological mismatch, she argues, has contributed to growing tensions. The current resistance campaigns are largely youth-led, online-based, decentralised and seen as leaderless, mostly unfolding outside the established political class. Since last year, they have been driven by anger over the high cost of living, aggressive taxation, corruption and police brutality. But pointing to ethnic politics and incitement as fuelling the latest unrest, the president said on Wednesday: Let's stop ethnic division, hatred, pride and contempt. We are all Kenyans"". He vowed to use ""whatever means necessary"" to maintain peace and stability. He called on the police to shoot in the legs protesters who were targeting businesses, rather than killing them. His remarks sparked more outrage and mockery. Since last year, the Kenyan government has responded to protests and dissent with brutal crackdowns, including mass arrests and alleged abductions by security operatives.

Getty Images The police have been accused of using excessive force to quell the protests

It is a strategy that rights groups say has only deepened public outrage and alienated the citizens from the state, with the police accused of using excessive force to quell the protests. More than 100 people have been killed in successive waves of anti-government protests since June last year. The latest one on Monday claimed 38 lives, marking the deadliest day of unrest yet. Rather than serve as a catalyst for police reform or push efforts to pacify the demonstrators, the deaths have often served as a spark for subsequent protests, turning grief into rage. The government has blamed the violence on protesters, accusing them of attacking police stations and even trying to stage a coup. Political communication expert Dr Hesbon Owilla calls the unrest ""probably the most intense outrage against a regime"" in Kenya's history. He says it has brought people from all walks of life to unite in defiance. He puts it down to how the president communicates to the people. He says Ruto's promises to uplift the fortunes of ordinary people were ""real, extremely real"" and shifted the campaign from ethnic mobilisation toward issue-based politics. ""Then he became president. We are still waiting. What Kenyans are experiencing is worse,"" he tells the BBC, capturing the deep sense of disappointment among many Kenyans. He says that unlike past governments that made cautious promises, Ruto made, and continues to make, sweeping pledges leading to broken expectations. ""The disillusionment is creating the rage,"" he says.

Bloomberg via Getty Images Ruto promised to champion the interest of the ordinary person

Citing the example of the order to shoot protesters, he also says that the president often speaks when silence might serve him better - overexposing himself and inadvertently making serious national issues feel personal. As a result, when there is criticism, it tends to be directed squarely at him, rather than being attributed to a failure of governance systems. Even so, Ruto has repeatedly highlighted his administration's efforts to better the lives of all Kenyans, pointing to the government's flagship affordable housing project, a universal health scheme, digital jobs, and an overseas employment programme as key achievements. While inspecting one of the housing sites this week, he acknowledged the severity of youth unemployment but emphasised that the problem predates his presidency. He insisted that his government was the first to take deliberate steps to tackle the crisis, citing state initiatives such as the housing project that he says has created hundreds of thousands of jobs. The president appealed for patience, as the problem would take time to resolve. Yet patience, especially amid the high cost of living, unmet expectations, and growing frustration, is not something that most Kenyans feel they can afford. Some of those flagship programmes have come at a steep cost to Kenyans, who now have 1.5% housing levy and a 2.75% health insurance tax deducted from their monthly incomes. The pain of paying some of these higher taxes has dominated everyday conversations, especially with a perception that higher taxes have not resulted in better public services. To the government's credit, Dr Owilla says some of the initiatives, like the universal healthcare project, have had a great impact, and others may eventually deliver for many. But Mr Bichachi argues that the government has ""lost touch with how people feel"", and its tone has remained unchanged despite rising public resentment. He says the issue is unlikely to change based on how the government performs – describing it as a ""love-hate relationship"" between the people and the presidency. That is ""how we find ourselves where we are"", he concludes, referring to the intense resentment that is now faced by the president, who was once one of the ""the most applauded and lauded leaders to come onto the Kenyan state"".

"Matiang’i rallies diaspora to vote, pushes for electoral reforms","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Former Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang’i has urged Kenyans living in the United States to actively participate in shaping their country’s future by voting in elections.

Speaking during engagements with the diaspora community, the former CS reiterated the importance of translating patriotism into action through voting.

“My brothers and sisters, whatever we do, unless we are participating in making that decision on who is going to make decisions for us, I mean, what are we going to talk about?,” he posed. “If we are not participating, we can only whine and complain about it,”

Matiang’i expressed concern about the low voter turnout in the 2022 elections, highlighting that of the approximately 300,000 Kenyans residing in the U.S., only around 10,000 registered to vote, and fewer than 3,000 actually cast their ballots.

In response, he announced plans to advocate for greater electoral access for Kenyans in the diaspora, starting with a formal proposal to increase polling stations in the United States from the current three to at least ten or fifteen.

“We are going to form a small team that brings together leaders and representatives from other cities in the U.S,” he said

“We have already started a process of both petitioning the IEBC and also with the prospective of going to court, if need be, to see to it that we have more polling stations here in the United States so that more Kenyans can vote,” Matiang’i added during the town hall meeting.

Highlighting his extensive experience in government, Matiang’i asserted that he possesses a deep understanding of public administration.

“After 10 years in Cabinet – including four as coordinator of government activities – I understand how government works, almost like the back of my hand,” he stated. “I know what needs to be done, and I’m ready to do it.”

Having declared his intention to run for the Presidency, Matiang’i called on Kenyans at home and abroad to trust him with leadership and hold him accountable.

“Since I have put my name on the ticket and I put my hand on this, my commitment is ‘hold me to account.’ I will not make excuses. I will not hide. I will not bend from responsibility. I will face responsibility head on and do the right thing,” he said

He told the diaspora that their involvement should extend beyond remittances, underscoring the importance of choosing the leadership they desire for Kenya.

“As the leaders or aspiring leaders, we can’t love your money and the remittance that you’re making, but we don’t love your contribution,” he said. “My first challenge to you wonderful people is that you need to participate in electing the leaders of Kenya, so that then you can hold people to account,”

At the same time, the former CS stated that Kenyans must move beyond mere rhetoric when discussing governance issues.

“If the middle class in Kenya actually wanted to change the country, they can. We can stay on X. It’s a good forum, we can engage, yes. But going to vote makes a difference. Because that way then you’ll be able to take decisions that affect the way in which your country is managed,” he remarked

Kenya and Germany cement bilateral labour agreements,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Kenya is exploring vocational training opportunities in Germany for development of skills that meet international job requirements.

Labour Principal Secretary Shadrack Mwadime says the bilateral labour agreements signed between Kenya and Germany in September last year are being fast tracked for the benefit of both parties.

He spoke upon return from leading a Kenyan delegation to Germany on operationalization of the bilateral labour agreements.

Labour Principal Secretary Shadrack Mwadime, who led the delegation, said the Bilateral Labour Agreement between Kenya and Germany was signed in September 2024, adding that the discussions dwelt on ways of enhancing the mobility of skilled labour in various sectors that are experiencing shortages.

The PS also explained that the two sides discussed ways of boosting vocational training opportunities for Kenyans, skills development to ensure potential employees meet international job requirements and also the protection of workers’ rights while in Germany.

“We held discussions with the German Commissioner for Labour, the lead negotiator, and agreed on the need for Germany to deploy teachers of German to our technical and vocational colleges and universities,” he said. “The ability to speak German is critical to getting a job opportunity in the country.”

He disclosed that the German Government already has agreed with Mt Kenya University on an arrangement of deploying teachers of German to teach the language.

“But in our discussions, we went further and agreed that a public university should benefit from such an arrangement. Consequently, Kenyatta University has been chosen for the purpose,” Mr Mwadime said.

He also explained that understanding the German culture for potential employees is crucial, and it was therefore agreed that pre-departure training will be conducted to make young Kenyans understand what they expect when they arrive in Germany so that their social lives are not affected.

Additionally, the PS pointed out that the German job market works through internship as a pathway to getting permanent hiring.

“We want to use internships as the pathway to eventual permanent jobs. Internship opportunities pay well and interns earn a stipend that meets accommodation and living expenses,” he explained.

Mr Mwadime explained that the meetings were successful and pointed out that the labour market in Germany is ideal for young, educated, well-trained and hardworking young Kenyans.

“Our young people will not only earn good pay in Germany, but they will also learn modern skills through which they will eventually transfer the knowledge and expertise to Kenya,” he said.

He added: “Germany has good labour laws and the minimum wage is higher than in many other countries. Our young people will thus be able to save and invest at home.”

The Kenyan delegation, which included National Employment Authority Director-General Edith Okoki, National Social Security Fund Managing Trustee David Koros and National Industrial Training Authority acting Director-General Theresa Wasike, met German Labour, Chamber of Commerce and Industry officials and top management of more than 30 companies in Berlin, Frankfurt and Stuttgart cities.

The officials expressed confidence that the Kenyan workforce would meet the demands of the job market in Germany, saying the workforce would be supported to integrate seamlessly upon arrival.

The companies specialise in fields such as manufacturing, construction, pharmaceuticals and ICT, among others. They include Rothenberger Werkzeuge, Strabag AG, Merck KGaA, Digital Reality, Germany GmbH and Fragomen Global.

Others are GOPA Worldwide Consultants, IHK Frankfurt am Main and Klinik-und Rehabilitationszentrum Lippoldsberg, among others.

The CEO of BIWE Group, a German education and training company, Mr Stefan Kupper, said: “We are seeking highly motivated young people who have completed vocational training of at least three years, have a good school education, a good mindset and German language competence. They should come in as skilled workers or as engineering and IT professionals.”

He pointed out that German language competence is important for integration in the workforce and in society.

Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce and Industry Managing Director of International Business Jurgen Ratzinger said the Bilateral Labour Agreement signed between Kenya and Germany was a good foundation for closer cooperation.

“Germany is in great need of skilled labour, and Kenya has a lot to offer in skilled labour. Both sides have to do their homework – Germany offers many jobs opportunities, while potential employees should be able to speak German. Language skills are therefore crucial at the preparatory phase,” he pointed out.",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-and-germany-cement-bilateral-labour-agreements/,real
"Kenya can’t afford to be average, says Ruto","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

President William Ruto has dismissed criticism that he “overpromised” Kenyans before his election, asserting that his ambitious agenda reflects a higher national aspiration.

Speaking during a church service in Machakos on Sunday, Ruto urged Kenyans to abandon a mindset of mediocrity and to embrace a future defined by excellence and transformation.

“For a long time, we’ve been stuck at average. We must stop being average,” the President stated, insisting that his commitment to Kenyans is not just empty rhetoric. “We must do better. That is my mission.”

Ruto stressed that raising the bar is not an overestimation of what’s possible but rather a declaration of confidence in Kenya’s potential.

“People say I have overpromised. I want to tell them: it’s not overpromising. We are raising our ambition as a nation,” he said.

Reaffirming his commitment to deliver on his campaign promises, Ruto disclosed that some leaders had even advised him to scale back certain commitments, a suggestion he firmly rejected.

“A bishop told me, ‘You said all these things just to get elected and now you need to plan how to step back from some of them.’ I have no such intention. I will keep every promise I made in my term,” he declared.

The President highlighted progress in various sectors, citing developments in agriculture and healthcare as evidence that transformation is already underway.

“Our economy is growing, and the numbers speak for themselves. Whether in maize, tea, sugar, or health, we are seeing progress,” he said. “By the grace of God and through unity, we will transform Kenya in our lifetime.”",https://www.kbc.co.ke/kenya-cant-afford-to-be-average-says-ruto/,real
Japan’s PM vows to stay on despite bruising election loss,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Japan’s ruling coalition has lost its majority in the country’s upper house, but Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said he has no plans to quit.

Voters went to the polls on Sunday for the tightly-contested election, being held at a time of frustration at the coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior partner Komeito over rising prices and the threat of US tariffs.

Speaking after polls closed on Sunday, the prime minister said he “solemnly” accepts the “harsh result” but that his focus was on trade negotiations.

Having already lost its majority in Japan’s more powerful lower house last year, the defeat will undermine the coalition’s influence.

The ruling coalition needed 50 seats to retain control of the 248-seat upper chamber. It ended up with 47.

The Constitutional Democratic Party, the main opposition, came in second with 22 seats.

Half of the seats in the upper chamber were being voted on in Sunday’s election, with members elected for six-year terms.

Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer in Japanese Studies at Kanda University of International Studies, told BBC News support for more right wing parties had cut into the LDP’s conservative support base.

“Prime Minister Ishiba is considered not conservative enough by many supporters of the former Prime Minister [Shinzo] Abe,” he said.

“They think that he just doesn’t have the nationalistic views on history, he doesn’t have the strong views against China that Abe had.”

Shinzo Abe was formerly the leader of the LDP and was Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, in office twice between 2006 and 2007, and 2012 and 2020.

Mr Hall said some of the party’s support had gone towards the Sanseito party – who would now be saying things which “haven’t been said in public before by members of the upper house,” – noting the party’s pull towards “conspiracy theories, anti-foreign statements, [and] very strong revisionist views about history”.

Ishiba’s centre-right party has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955, albeit with frequent changes of leader.

The result underscores voters’ frustration with Ishiba, who has struggled to inspire confidence as Japan struggles against economic headwinds, a cost-of-living crisis and trade negotiations with the United States.

Many are also unhappy about inflation – particularly the price of rice – and a string of political scandals that have beleaguered the LDP in recent years.

The last three LDP premiers who lost a majority in the upper house stepped down within two months, and analysts had predicted that a significant loss in this election would yield a similar outcome.

This would open the field for a potential run at the leadership by other notable LDP members, including Sanae Takaichi, who finished second to Ishiba in last year’s leadership election; Takayuki Kobayashi, a former economic security minister; and Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

In any case, a change of leadership within the ruling party would almost certainly unleash political drama and destabilise Japan’s government at a pivotal moment in US-Japan trade negotiations.

On Monday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed for a public holiday, but the yen strengthened on global markets against other major currencies as the results appeared to have been expected by investors.

Support for the ruling coalition appears to have been eroded by candidates from the small, right-leaning Sanseito party, led by Sohei Kamiya, who has been compared to Trump by some media outlets.

The party, which is known for its “Japanese First” policy, drew conservative votes with its anti-immigration rhetoric. On Sunday, it won 14 seats – a big addition to the single seat the party won in the last election.

Sanseito rose to prominence during the pandemic, as it peddled conspiracy theories on YouTube such as the “deep state” and warned people not to wear masks or vaccinate themselves.

The fringe party’s nativist rhetoric widened its appeal ahead of Sunday’s vote, as policies regarding foreign residents and immigration became a focal point of many parties’ campaigns.

Famous for its isolationist culture and strict immigration policies, the island nation has experienced a record surge in both tourists and foreign residents in recent years.

The influx has further driven up prices for Japanese people and fuelled a sentiment among some that foreigners are taking advantage of the country, aggravating discontent.

Against that same backdrop, Ishiba last week launched a task force aimed at tackling “crimes or nuisance behaviours committed by some foreign nationals”, including those relating to immigration, land acquisitions and unpaid social insurance.",https://www.kbc.co.ke/japans-pm-vows-to-stay-on-despite-bruising-election-loss/,real

The Government of Rwanda has welcomed the signing of the Declaration of Principles between the representatives of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the representatives of AFC/M23 in Doha, Qatar.

In a statement, Rwanda noted that the declaration, facilitated by the State of Qatar and supported by the United States, lays the groundwork for a comprehensive peace agreement aimed at resolving the decades-long crisis in the Great Lakes region.

Rwanda described the pact as a significant step towards a lasting pathway to a comprehensive peace agreement.

“Following last month’s signing of the Peace Agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and efforts of the Africa-led initiatives, today’s declaration in Doha is a significant step forward towards the peaceful resolution of conflict in eastern DRC, by addressing the root causes of the conflict and restoring security and stability in our region.” Stated Rwanda.

Rwanda expressed appreciation for the crucial mediation role of Qatar with the support of the United States Government, which builds on the efforts of the African Union, as well as the joint EAC/SADC initiatives, noting it has contributed to the milestone achieved today, Saturday in Doha.

“We all have to support continuation of progress to the conclusion.” Kigali remarked.

Further, Rwanda reaffirmed her commitment to contributing to sustainable peace as well as economic development in the Great Lakes region.

Govt rolls out insurance for farmers under fertilizer subsidy program,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Farmers in 11 counties who are beneficiaries of the fertilizer subsidy program being undertaken by the government will receive a crop insurance cover of up to Ksh 7000 in a move to mitigate losses as a result of climate change.

The Integrated Agricultural Insurance policy rolled out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development in collaboration with Pula, Bayer Foundation, Lemonade Foundation, SOMPO Digital Lab, and Etherisc on a pilot basis targets at least 250,000 farmers who are registered on the Kenya Integrated Agriculture Management Information System (KIAMIS).

“Agricultural insurance is a step in the right direction, especially now that climate-related risks are not a distant threat to our livelihoods. This partnership is critical as it will not only protect farmers from risks such as drought and floods but will also promote a sustainable safety net for our farmers, mainly those in Arid and Semi-Arid areas,” said Samuel Karogo, National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) managing director.

The insurance product will be embedded into subsidized fertilizer distribution, supporting the government’s broader vision of enabling farmers to adopt climate-smart practices and data-driven tools to improve productivity.

The cover is equivalent to the investment needed for two bags of subsidised fertilizer which they procure from NCPD depots across the country.

“This partnership is about creating meaningful access to resilience. At Bayer Foundation, we believe that insurance shouldn’t be a privilege for a few, but a tool that empowers underserved farmers, especially women and youth, to thrive in the face of climate change,” added Mildred Nadah Pita, Head of Public Affairs, Science & Sustainability, Africa at Bayer.

Farmers are automatically enrolled in the insurance scheme when receiving their subsidized fertilizer. and is deigned to de-risk smallholder farmers from climate-related threats, marking a major shift toward inclusive insurance at scale.

Educators from 35 counties have acquired training on AI literacy,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

170 secondary school teachers from 35 counties have completed their training in Artificial Intelligence (AI) through the AI literacy programme, Experience AI.

The six months programme undertaken through Young Scientists Kenya (YSK) initiative by the Ministry of Education and the Irish Embassy in collaboration with Raspberry Pi Foundation equipped educators with the knowledge and confidence to introduce AI concepts into the classroom in a bid to enhance STEM in schools.

According to YSK, the training empowers teachers to integrate emerging technologies into everyday lessons, helping prepare Kenya’s young people for the opportunities and challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

“Investing in STEM education is critical to Kenya’s future. Our decision to train teachers in Experience AI is strategic. By equipping educators with hands-on skills and tools, we ensure they are not just facilitators but active drivers of technological literacy in the classroom,” said Dr. Victor Mwongera, YSK National Director.

The initiative which is expected to reach 3,400 students across the country enables teachers to demystify complex digital concepts for learners, integrate AI tools into lesson planning, and cultivate a culture of computational thinking.

“Ireland fully supports YSK’s mission to empower young minds across Kenya. This includes ensuring inclusive participation from marginalised learners in arid and semi-arid lands, special needs schools, and refugee communities. By equipping teachers with AI knowledge, we make science accessible and drive real change for a more sustainable and equitable future,” added Caitriona Ingoldsby, Ambassador of Ireland to Kenya.

Kenya has told the meeting that its losing between 3 and 3 percent of its annual wealth to climate related catastrophes.

Speaking at the conference, Principal Secretary National Treasury Dr. Chris Kiptoo said Kenyans must rise to the realisation that climate change is here with us.

He cautioned that: “Our farmers must now start planting seeds that are climate resilient. Our engineers should start designing projects that can withstand the shocks of climate change.”

Kenya has managed to ink a deal with a number of financiers where more than Ksh.450B will be committed for production of green energy as well as sustainable agriculture.

The PS said the as a country we must use the resources we have optimally adding that: “at the National Treasury we are trying to mainstream climate change matters.”

While encouraging Kenyans to join in the campaign of planting the 15 billion trees within the next 10 years, and embrace climate smart technologies he urged leaders to demonstrate leadership and avoid lamenting.

Speaking at the same conference, the civil society voiced their concerns saying that the development partners are not walking the talk when it comes to availing the necessary resources to help African countries adapt to the changing climate change.

Executive Director Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) Mithika Mwenda stressed that Africa needs tangible solutions to climate change problems adding that adaptation finance is the solution for Africa.

“The era of false promises is long gone, Africa needs tangible solutions. African leaders should be bold and not fail to fake promises.” Said Mithika.

Plans to craft Kenya’s first tax policy have been on the card for a long time with the private sector nudging the government to establish the policy in order to create a predictable taxation environment.

The policy recommends comprehensive reviews of tax laws every five years and adequate stakeholder engagement before any amendment of tax laws.

"DeepSeek a ‘wake-up call’ for US tech firms, Trump says","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

US President Donald Trump has called the rise of Chinese company DeepSeek “a wake-up call” for the US tech industry, after the emergence of its artificial intelligence (AI) model triggered shockwaves on Wall Street.

Shares in major tech firms such as Nvidia fell sharply, with the chip giant losing almost $600bn (£482bn) in market value.

What has shaken the industry is DeepSeek’s claim that its R1 model was made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals – raising questions about the future of America’s AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.

DeepSeek has become the most downloaded free app in the US just a week after it was launched.

Responding to the news, Trump said the latest developments in China’s AI industry may be “a positive” for the US. “If you could do it cheaper, if you could do it [for] less [and] get to the same end result. I think that’s a good thing for us,” he told reporters on board Air Force One. He also said he was not concerned about the breakthrough, adding the US will remain a dominant player in the field. DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m (£4.2m) – significantly less than the billions spent by rivals. But this claim has been disputed by others in AI. Its emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China. To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology. This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before. It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry. Following the shock to markets in the US on Monday, the FTSE 100 stock index of the UK’s biggest publicly-listed companies appeared resilient in early trading on Tuesday, rising by 0.46%. Futures on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index were also up by 0.1% after Nvidia stock had ticked up slightly in after-hours trading. But shares in Japanese AI-related firms including Advantest, Softbank and Tokyo Electron fell sharply, helping to push the benchmark Nikkei 225 down by 1.4%. Several other markets in Asia are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Mainland China’s financial markets will be shut from Tuesday and will reopen on 5 February.

"One year of Ghana Trade House in Kenya, a milestone in country’s export strategy","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

The Ghana Trade House in Nairobi, Kenya marks one year of operation, a milestone in the sustained implementation of the National Export Development Strategy (NEDS). The Trade House was established by the Ghana Export Promotion Authority, GEPA in collaboration with the Association of Ghana Industries, AGI and has since become an important venue for marketing Ghana’s Non-Traditional Exports(NTEs) to the East African Market.

The Nairobi Trade House forms part of the umbrella 10-year NEDS strategy launched in October 2020 to transform Ghana’s export landscape through an increase in revenue from non-traditional exports.

This highly ambitious and commendable strategy is chasing a revenue target of USD 25.3 billion by the year 2029 and places Ghana in the spotlight of the global export market. This is the first of its kind in East Africa and represents one strategic objective of GEPA through the AfCFTA for increased intra-African trade, exploit new market opportunities, and foster closer economic relations throughout the continent.

A Hub for Promoting Made-in-Ghana Products

From its inauguration in May 2023, the Ghana Trade House in Nairobi has been an active contact point for the promotion of the entire range of NTEs from Ghana.

The key objective of the Ghana Trade House is to sell and promote manufactured goods from Ghana, while also deepening economic relations between Ghana and countries in East Africa. The Trade House, being one of the critical facilities within AfCFTA, has successfully provided an important outlet for Ghanaian exporters into Eastern Africa’s fast-growing markets. The state-of-the-art facility ensures that suppliers’ and consumers’ experience is smooth and up to date with the latest infrastructure meant to make the process of exporting smoother.

This is where more than 250 varieties of Ghanaian products totaling over 6,500 items are sold and marketed. These products cut across many industries: textiles, food and beverages, cosmetics, handicrafts, among others. The Trade House not only acts as a retail outlet but also as a wholesale distribution center that assists Ghanaian businesses in efficiently reaching the East African market.

Products at the Trade House are carefully curated to fit the diverse interests of regional consumers representing premium quality and the distinctive heritage of Ghana. Such diversification shows the breadth and depth of NTEs in Ghana, which, over these years, has been significant in the country’s policy of diversifying the economy from traditional commodities such as unprocessed gold, cocoa beans, lumber, and oil.

Empowering Ghanaian Exporters and East African Consumers

The Ghana Trade House is committed to the responsibility that would enable Ghanaian exporters with an assured and efficient platform for showcasing products to penetrate the East African market.

Similarly, the Trade House simplifies often complex logistical challenges associated with international trade, facilitating the consolidation of products, receipt, processing, and fulfilling orders on behalf of Ghanaian businesses. To the consumers in East Africa, the Trade House has been a destination point of discovery on unique and quality products that Ghana has to offer. This is everything, from premium cosmetics based on shea butter to intricately woven textiles, leatherwear, to high quality food products such as chocolates and other cocoa products, dried fruits, spices and food ingredients, ready-to-eat snacks and other processed food.

The Ghana Trade House has brought a new and exciting range of goods into the Kenyan market. This mutually rewarding relationship between Ghanaian suppliers and East African consumers speaks to the power of AfCFTA in fostering regional trade and economic integration.

The vision of GEPA looks beyond Nairobi to the replication of this model in other African countries, targeting key markets that are crucial to the growth of Ghana’s NTEs.

Looking Ahead: Future Prospects for the Ghana Trade House

In Ghana’s march towards attaining the aspirations of the NEDS, the Ghana Trade House in Nairobi will constantly be an important instrument in this endeavour.

Over the next few years, GEPA intends to expand operations, diversify products on offer, and consolidate the relationships that it has built up with Kenyan businesses and consumers.

Conclusion: A Celebration of Success and a Vision to the Future

The one-year anniversary of the opening of the Ghana Trade House in Nairobi thus marks a proud moment not only for GEPA and Ghanaian exporters but for the bigger and broader vision of AfCFTA in the creation of one single, prosperous African market.

Indeed, this milestone represents the culmination of hard work, dedication, and a shared commitment to driving Africa’s economic transformation through trade.

A series of activities have been lined up from the 5th to 15th October in Kenya and Tanzania to mark the anniversary. These include activations in Nairobi and Mombasa, a business forum on Dar es Salaam, a Ghana food bazaar as well as the grand durbar at the venue of the facility at the Sameer Business Park.

As we forge into the future, the Ghana Trade House will stand ready to be the continuing salient link between our Ghanaian producers and the wider African market, furthering this vision of a more integrated and economically vibrant continent.",https://www.kbc.co.ke/one-year-of-ghana-trade-house-in-kenya-a-milestone-in-countrys-export-strategy/,real
"Gov’t to install milk coolers in all wards, says CS Chelugui","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Dairy farmers have a reason to smile following the government’s pledge to install milk coolers in the modernization programme of Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC) facilities in all wards countrywide.

The State has announced that the move has been motivated by the need to eliminate middlemen who buy milk at throw-away prices in rural areas and later make profits by selling the commodity at higher prices in the upper market.

Cooperatives and Micro and Small Enterprise Cabinet Secretary Mr. Simon Chelugui acknowledged that dairy farmers struggle with challenges of storage, preservation of milk, the high cost of feed and access to markets.

He said the Kenya Kwanza administration has taken immediate steps to reinstate the stalled milk coolers’ programme and the distribution of 650 milk coolers was on course.

“In our plan, we have identified the dairy and livestock economy as sub-sectors with the quickest economic turnaround time and they will become key drivers in improving food security, creating jobs and boosting exports,” he said.

Chelugui revealed that the government was working on plans to establish a milk price-stabilizing fund of close to Sh3 billion.

The milk fund is scheduled to be implemented by the New Kenya Cooperative Creameries. New KCC is 100 per cent owned by the government.

He said the funds will be used to mop up excess milk from farmers and convert the milk into long-life products to be stored in the Strategic Food Reserve. This is among the many interventions aimed at ensuring a stable and prosperous dairy subsector.

“The government will mop up the milk, convert it into powder milk, package it and store it in the Strategic Food Reserve. As soon as we get to January, even the private processors will be free to buy the same dry milk at a price the regulator will provide,” said Chelugui.

Chelugui spoke when he met dairy and coffee farmers from Bahati Sub-County in Nakuru.

The funds will be used to stabilize the price of the commodity in the market and ensure that all the milk is collected from farmers.

“The stabilization fund is an intervention the government takes to absorb extra milk. It does not take away the respective dairy process of milk,” Chelugui said.

Currently, milk production has gone up because of the good weather the country is enjoying. The CS said mopping up of excess milk is an activity the government has done before.

Mr. Chelugui noted that the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA) recognized the dairy subsector as a pivotal value chain due to its substantial contributions to the national and rural economy.

“Processors sometimes grapple with a high supply of milk from farmers due to a glut that goes beyond the intake capacity of the factories, but the funds will be used to stabilize the price of the commodity in the market and ensure that we collect all the milk from farmers,” said the Cabinet Secretary.

He added, “This is an intervention the government is taking to absorb extra milk. When we have excess milk production, some processors abandon the farmers, and therefore the government is committed to taking up this and processing for future use.”

The Cabinet Secretary stated that in future excess milk will be stored in Strategic Food Reserves (SFR) as powdered milk for future use and urged other private processors to also buy more milk from farmers for conversion into powder.

The dairy subsector faces significant challenges, including high breeding costs, disease prevalence, insufficient extension services, expensive animal feed, limited value addition, post-harvest losses, and low market access.

The New KCC has been tasked with the mandate to stabilize both producer and consumer milk prices by efficiently managing milk surpluses during the glut period by converting excess milk into a strategic food reserve in the form of dry milk powder, which can be released back into the market during dry seasons.

Mr Chelugui said Kenya has the potential to grow the dairy milk production up to four million liters per day.

The Cabinet Secretary said New KCC will buy milk from farmers at a minimum price of Sh45 per liter, to curb exploitation by middlemen and other players in the sector.

Chelugui announced that the first disbursement of Sh500 million stabilization fund was done in December and appealed to farmers to continue supplying milk to New KCC collection centers across the country.

“We received a further Shs 400 million and we are expecting another Shs 500 million before the end of January. The Government’s resolve is to protect dairy farming like any other businesses in the country. The minimum price of buying milk is fair and enables farmers to earn good returns despite the high cost of operation,” he said.

He regretted that unscrupulous traders have ruined the dairy sector prompting many people to abandon dairy farming, which has subsequently led to a significant drop in milk production in the country.

“We have local and international markets for our agricultural produce and the county and national government is deliberately working with farmers’ cooperative societies to scale up milk production,” said CS Chelugui.

Chelugui said that the government has secured a market for Kenyan milk in the Middle East.

“Lack of storage facilities is among the challenges that have hindered the production of quality and sufficient milk in Kenya. And we are working with the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure that we have the capacity of milk that meets the internal demand,” he said.

Mr Chelugui further said that farmers will access stimulus funds through cooperative societies to boost animal and crop production.",https://www.kbc.co.ke/govt-to-install-milk-coolers-in-all-wards-says-cs-chelugui/,real

Kenyans fund Maraga's 2027 presidential bid with half a million in 48 hours,"Former Chief Justice David Maraga and Reuben Kigame at Kahawa Law Courts on July 16, 2025. [Chebet Berir, Standard]

Former Chief Justice David Maraga says Kenyans have given more than Sh 500,000 within two days to fuel his 2027 presidential bid, a move he says shows a growing public hunger for change.

Maraga, who in 2017 led the Supreme Court in nullifying former President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election over irregularities following a petition by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, says he launched a website to collect public donations as he seeks to challenge President William Ruto in the next general election.

""I told you that I don't have money and I am going to appeal, I mean, I am already appealing to the Kenyan people,"" noted Maraga.

Maraga explains that contributions, including dollars from Kenyans abroad, show frustration with the country's leadership and support for his candidacy.

""Those in the diaspora are putting dollars so that tells you that the Kenyans want change,"" observed Maraga.

The former chief justice points out that he wants to reform Kenya's electoral system to allow individuals without financial resources to run for public office, noting that the current system locks out qualified candidates who cannot match big campaign budgets.

""Given an opportunity, that's one area I am going to address so that young people who have no money, ladies who have no money, anybody else who has no money but has leadership qualities can come and be elected,"" explained Maraga.

Maraga has criticised Ruto's administration, claiming it has undermined constitutional governance by failing to protect Kenyans' rights.

""The president is terrorising his own people,"" stated Maraga.

He notes that Parliament has failed to hold the president accountable, accusing it of being captured by the executive and failing to exercise its oversight role.

""Parliament is supposed to take action when the president is violating the constitution and impeach him,"" argued Maraga.

Maraga says his decision to run in 2027 aims to restore constitutional order and protect the rights of Kenyans, adding that the country's democratic processes have weakened under the current administration.""Now Parliament is not doing it and that's why I have come up and I have support to remove him in 2027,"" he noted..",https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/politics/article/2001524831/kenyans-fund-maragas-2027-presidential-bid-with-half-a-million-in-48-hours,real

“It wasn’t a competitive match. The students were just enjoying themselves like they always do,"" the principal said.

He said that the deceased had scored two goals, and he was going to score the third one when he jumped up and fell down.

The school has initiated counselling sessions and morning reflection periods to support affected learners.

“We’re managing the emotional impact and guiding students through this difficult time,” the principal added.

The school principal confirmed that the deceased had no known medical issues or conditions prior to the incident.

""There were no warning signs, no health history to suggest this. It just happened suddenly, and it has left us all devastated,"" said Mambili.

The principal further explained that doctors are still investigating the exact cause of death, as the school awaits a formal medical report.

He added that the death of the student has caused an impact on students, especially his close friends who witnessed the incident and were directly involved in trying to help him.

How taxing sugary drinks could be Kenya's answer to lifestyle diseases,"How taxing sugary drinks could be Kenya’s answer to lifestyle diseases

Male worker examining bottles in juice factory. [Courtesy/GettyImages]

About a month ago, Nandi Hills MP Bernard Kitur appeared before the National Assembly Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning during public hearings on the Finance Bill 2025 and proposed the introduction of a health promotion levy.

As a health research scientist, this proposition presented a glimmer of hope for our nation’s health environment. However, I recognize that any new tax proposal raises valid concerns about increasing the burden on already strained citizens.

Yet, if we consider the MP’s proposal from a health perspective, it may well be the intervention we have been waiting for to curb the rising cases of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs).

Kitur proposed taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages. The levy would target drinks with more than four grams of sugar per 100 milliliters. For those exceeding the limit, locally produced drinks would be charged Sh1 per gramme of sugar per 100ml, while imported soft drinks would be taxed double at Sh2 per gramme.

The urgency behind this proposal becomes clear when we examine Kenya’s health landscape. Kenya faces a growing NCD crisis, with diabetes prevalence standing at 3.1 per cent of the adult population—nearly a million adults—and is projected to double by 2050. Obesity rates are climbing steadily among both adults and children.

The economic burden on our healthcare system continues to mount, making prevention strategies more critical than ever. Recent studies on the effects of sugar-sweetened beverages on the body show clear association with rising cases of NCDs such as diabetes and obesity.

A typical carbonated soft drink contains about nine teaspoons, 35 grammes of sugar and around 140 calories, delivering energy but little nutritional value.

These beverages are usually consumed quickly and do not provide the same feeling of fullness that solid food does. This means consumers don’t typically reduce intake of other foods to compensate for the extra calories.

The result is excess calories contributing to overweight and obesity as they are easily converted to body fat. Over time, this builds a major public health problem.

This health-focused approach offers significant advantages over the existing revenue-based model. The strength of this new strategy lies in its dual benefit: discouraging excess sugar consumption through higher prices and enhancing transparency in labeling.

If implemented, the levy would require manufacturers and importers to declare sugar content during registration, production or importation.

This could drive reformulation to reduce sugar content while generating funds for public health campaigns and school nutrition programmes.

Kenyans now face a choice: continue treating diabetes and obesity after they develop, or embrace proactive policies that prevent them in the first place. The evidence is clear, the need is urgent, and the solution is before us.

Let’s not dismiss this as another tax. Let’s recognise this as a public health tool, an investment in our nation’s long-term well-being and economic stability.

Iron deficiency: Health crisis mostly affecting women and children,"A mother holding her son. [Courtesy/GettyImages]

A recent review published in The Lancet Haematology reveals that iron deficiency affects up to one in three women worldwide, making it the most prevalent nutrient deficiency globally.

Iron is essential for energy production, brain development, and maintaining a healthy immune system. Yet despite its importance, millions, particularly women and children, continue to suffer the consequences of iron deficiency.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anaemia—a condition largely caused by iron deficiency—affects 31 per cent of adult women of reproductive age, 36 per cent of pregnant women, and 40 per cent of children under five.

Iron is crucial for the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. When iron levels are too low, haemoglobin production decreases, leading to anaemia. Common symptoms include pale skin and gums, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid or irregular heartbeat.

Iron deficiency, particularly when it progresses to anaemia, can have serious health implications. It is associated with a weakened immune system, complications during pregnancy and childbirth, increased risk of maternal and infant death, and delays in a child’s physical and cognitive development.

Women and children are especially vulnerable. Menstruating women lose iron every month, increasing their nutritional needs. Pregnant women require more iron to support the development of the placenta, foetus, and increased maternal blood volume. Children, especially in the early years, need sufficient iron for growth and brain development. Adolescent girls are at particular risk due to the dual demands of growth and menstruation.

Beyond dietary insufficiency, inflammation from acute illness or chronic conditions, such as obesity, can reduce the body’s ability to absorb iron. With rates of chronic disease and obesity rising globally, this presents a growing challenge in the fight against iron deficiency.

In The Lancet Haematology report, Dr Ashley Benson and Dr Jamie Lo from Oregon Health and Science University convened a panel of 26 global experts and four patient representatives to develop comprehensive recommendations. Their findings call for a more inclusive and proactive approach to tackling iron deficiency, particularly among high-risk populations.

They stress the need for routine screening during pregnancy and early childhood—times when iron demands are highest. The panel also recommends the use of ferritin, a blood protein that reflects the body’s iron stores, as a reliable marker for diagnosing deficiency and determining when to intervene.

When treatment is necessary, oral iron supplements are the first line of action. They are effective, widely available, and affordable. For people who experience side effects such as nausea or constipation, taking supplements every day may help with tolerability. When oral treatment is not effective or tolerated, intravenous iron may be required.

The experts further emphasise that iron deficiency should not be addressed in isolation but integrated into routine maternal and child health services—such as antenatal check-ups, child wellness visits, and nutrition programmes—ensuring iron levels are monitored alongside other key health indicators.

To prevent and manage anaemia, individuals are encouraged eat a healthy, varied diet that includes iron-rich foods such as lean red meats, fish, poultry, legumes (e.g., lentils and beans), fortified cereals, and dark green leafy vegetables.

They should also consume foods high in vitamin C (such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, and broccoli) to help improve iron absorption.

There is also need to avoiding substances that inhibit iron absorption. These include bran, wholewheat flour, oats, tea, coffee, cocoa, and calcium-rich foods.

It is crucial to consult a doctor if you experience heavy menstrual bleeding, as this may necessitate iron supplements or hormonal contraceptives.

You should protect against infections that can cause or worsen anaemia and practise good hygiene—wash hands regularly with soap and water, and use clean toilets.

Addressing iron deficiency is not only a medical priority—it is a social and economic one. Ensuring women and children have access to proper nutrition, screening, and treatment will yield benefits for individual health, family wellbeing, and national development.",https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001524864/iron-deficiency-health-crisis-mostly-affecting-women-and-children,real
Restless nights? Nocturia may be the hidden culprit disrupting your sleep,"A woman suffering from sleepless nights. [Courtesy/GettyImages]

Nocturia, a medical term used to describe the need to wake up multiple times during the night to urinate, is far more than a minor annoyance. For many, it’s a persistent thief of restful sleep and daily energy.

Affecting millions, especially older adults, nocturia can wear down physical stamina, shake social confidence and gradually erode overall vitality. Yet, by understanding its root causes and taking targeted action, those restless nights can be reclaimed.

Dr Emily Mwendwa, a urologist passionate about restoring quality of life through holistic health strategies, offers vital insights into the condition. She explains that nocturia isn’t caused by a single factor; rather, it’s often a complex puzzle where medical conditions and lifestyle habits intersect. Identifying the precise trigger, she says, is key to finding relief.

Often, nocturia arises from underlying health issues that either affect bladder function or disrupt urine production. One of the most common contributors is Overactive Bladder (OAB), where the bladder contracts involuntarily, creating an intense, often uncontrollable urge to urinate, even when it isn’t full. This leads to frequent and urgent trips to the bathroom, making restful sleep difficult to achieve.

Diabetes is another major cause. When blood sugar is poorly controlled, the kidneys work overtime to remove excess glucose, producing more urine in the process. This increased output often becomes most noticeable during the night, particularly in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Liver and kidney diseases also play a role. When these organs aren’t functioning properly, they struggle to maintain fluid balance, prompting the body to expel excess fluids at night. Heart failure follows a similar mechanism. During the day, fluid often builds up in the lower limbs. When a person lies down, this fluid redistributes through the bloodstream, triggering the kidneys to produce more urine.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a more acute but common cause. They irritate the bladder lining, resulting in a constant sensation of needing to urinate, even when very little urine is present. This discomfort frequently disrupts sleep, especially in those prone to recurrent infections.

In men, an enlarged prostate is a major factor. The enlarged gland presses against the urethra, making it difficult for the bladder to empty completely. The residual urine leads to repeated trips to the bathroom, especially at night.

Obesity, too, has a hand in the condition. Excess body weight places pressure on the bladder, decreasing its capacity and prompting more frequent urination. Pregnancy has a similar effect, especially in the third trimester, as the growing uterus compresses the bladder and limits how much it can hold.

Hormonal shifts during menopause weaken the pelvic floor muscles and alter bladder function, increasing nocturia risk among women. Additionally, high calcium levels in the blood, known as hypercalcemia, though less common, can interfere with kidney function and lead to increased urine production.

Each of these medical scenarios set off a ripple effect, turning what should be a restful night into a fragmented and frustrating experience. Dr Mwendwa underscores the importance of pinpointing the specific cause, as treating it directly can dramatically reduce nighttime disruptions.

While medical factors form one side of the equation, lifestyle habits often tip the balance. Dr Mwendwa points out that what we consume and when we consume it can have a profound impact on the bladder’s behavior.

Drinking large amounts of water or tea late in the evening can overwork the bladder while the body is supposed to rest.

The kidneys continue processing these fluids during sleep, often resulting in multiple awakenings.

Caffeine and alcohol are particular culprits. Both act as diuretics and bladder irritants, increasing urine production and making the bladder more sensitive. Combined with other medical conditions, these seemingly innocuous habits can significantly exacerbate nocturia.

Dr Mwendwa recommends tackling nocturia with a well-rounded strategy that includes lifestyle changes, behavioral therapies, and, where necessary, medical treatment.

She encourages starting with small, manageable modifications to daily routines. Reducing fluid intake two to three hours before bedtime allows the bladder to empty ahead of sleep. If thirst strikes, sipping small amounts is acceptable, but large glasses of water, juice or tea should be avoided. Caffeine and alcohol should be minimized, especially in the evening, as they not only increase urine output but also irritate the bladder lining.

Behavioral therapies can empower individuals to regain control over their bladder habits. Bladder training involves gradually delaying urination during the day, teaching the bladder to hold more urine and resist frequent urges. It requires patience but has shown promising results. Pelvic floor exercises, commonly known as Kegels, strengthen the muscles that support bladder control.

By taking small, intentional steps and seeking medical guidance when needed, restful nights can return. As Dr Mwendwa affirms, addressing nocturia isn’t just about eliminating nighttime bathroom trips, but about restoring the energy, clarity, and confidence that come from uninterrupted sleep.",https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001524862/restless-nights-nocturia-may-be-the-hidden-culprit-disrupting-your-sleep,real
Doctors' union wants interns out of Kiambu as strike bites day 55,"KMPDU officials led by Central Branch chairman Dr James Githinji, National chairman Dr Abidan Mwachi, Dr Bill Muriuki and Dr Caroline Mwaura during a press briefing where they issued a strike notice on May 27, 2025. [Wilberforce Okwiri,Standard]

The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) has asked the Ministry of Health (MOH) to withdraw one hundred fifty medical interns from Kiambu County as a doctors’ strike paralyses hospitals for fifty-five days.

The union explained that the interns, deployed to Kiambu in 2024, cannot serve patients or receive proper supervision due to the prolonged dispute.

“We have formally written to the Ministry of Health requesting the immediate transfer of the one hundred fifty medical interns out of Kiambu County to other hospitals where they can serve effectively,” noted Secretary General Davji Atellah of KMPDU in a statement on Monday, July 21.

Atellah observed that the absence of senior doctors for mentorship in Kiambu has disrupted patient care and intern training, making the environment unsafe.“Deploying trainees in an environment where such support is absent undermines the quality of training required under internship programme guidelines,” explained Atellah.

The union directly called on the Kiambu government to take responsibility for the crisis, which has crippled health services across the county.

“This is day fifty-five of the strike, and we do not see an end in sight. As a union, we will remain on strike until justice is served,” added Atellah.

The union has also scheduled a National Advisory Council (NAC) meeting to deliberate on the crisis and has issued a notice for a demonstration in Kiambu on July 24.

Atellah stated that KCG has ignored court orders and failed to appear in court despite multiple summons regarding the dispute.

“We expect the courts to take decisive action on Wednesday, July 23, including jailing those responsible for contempt,” noted Atellah.

Doctors in Kiambu began their strike in late May, demanding payment of salary arrears, delayed promotions, medical cover and improved working conditions.

Atellah explained that maintaining professional standards in medical training should take precedence over administrative convenience as interns continue to face challenges in Kiambu.

This comes days after pre-interns were directed to collect their posting letters in person at the ministry headquarters in Nairobi.

The union urged the government to repost the interns to counties with functioning health systems to protect patient care and uphold internship training guidelines.",https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001524850/doctors-union-wants-interns-out-of-kiambu-as-strike-bites-day-55,real

"Vaccines save lives, let's protect our children from typhoid and measles","A child being vaccinated in Ortum in West Pokot County. [File, Standard]

Kenya marked yet another significant milestone in its quest to address age-old preventable diseases that continue to place a significant burden on the country's healthcare system. On Friday July 5, the country became the fifth country in Africa to introduce the Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV), which has been recommended for control of typhoid in countries with a high burden of the disease—Kenya being one of them.

Typhoid fever remains a significant public health challenge in many developing countries, including Kenya. The disease, caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, is transmitted through contaminated food and water with communities that have poor access to clean water and sanitation facilities at particularly high risk. Typhoid disproportionately affects children under the age of 15 years and elderly and immuno-compromised individuals.

Surveys, including one by the World Health Organization in 2022, show that typhoid fever continues to affect an estimated 9–12 million people globally every year, with sub-Saharan Africa accounting for a significant proportion of these cases. Kenya, like many countries in the region, experiences seasonal typhoid outbreaks that place an additional burden on already strained healthcare systems, especially in urban and peri-urban areas.

More concerning is the rising threat of antimicrobial-resistant strains of Salmonella Typhi, which cause typhoid fever. These strains are becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics, making treatment more difficult and costly. This resistance is driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics and is further compounded by limited access to diagnostic testing.

This is why the introduction of the Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV) is both timely and critical. Unlike older typhoid vaccines, TCV is safe for children as young as six months and provides longer-lasting protection. It significantly reduces the need for antibiotic use, helping to combat the growing crisis of antimicrobial resistance. Kenya now joins a growing list of countries that have incorporated TCV into their routine immunisation schedules as a long-term, cost-effective intervention to prevent typhoid illness and its associated complications.

Equally urgent is our Measles-Rubella (MR) campaign. Although we have made progress in controlling measles, coverage remains uneven. National surveys show that while the first dose of the MR vaccine has relatively high uptake, the second dose still falls below the recommended 95% coverage threshold required to maintain herd immunity. This leaves pockets of susceptible children at risk, especially in underserved and nomadic populations. The danger is real—measles is one of the most contagious human diseases, capable of spreading rapidly and causing serious complications such as pneumonia, diarrhea, encephalitis, and even death.

Rubella, while generally mild, poses serious risks to pregnant women, including miscarriage and congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause lifelong disabilities in infants. A successful MR campaign helps prevent such outcomes while also strengthening overall immunisation systems through outreach and community engagement.

The Ministry of Health, through the National Vaccines and Immunisation Programme, remains fully committed to reaching every eligible child. With strong support from global health partners including Gavi, UNICEF and PATH, we have trained thousands of health workers, developed microplans at county and sub-county levels, and mobilised resources for logistics and social mobilisation.

Let us be clear: all vaccines in our immunisation programme are approved by the World Health Organization and the Pharmacy and Poisons Board. They are safe, scientifically validated, and rigorously monitored for quality.

Vaccination is more than a personal decision—it is a public responsibility. High immunisation coverage creates herd immunity, protecting even those who cannot be vaccinated. It strengthens our ability to withstand disease outbreaks, reduces healthcare costs, and contributes to national development by ensuring that children grow up healthy and able to learn.

As we roll out this campaign, I urge parents and guardians to take their children to the nearest health facilities or outreach posts. I urge local leaders, faith institutions, educators, and the media to support fact-based health communication. And I call on health workers to continue being our most trusted messengers and defenders of public health.

This campaign is a bold step towards a healthier, more resilient Kenya. Let us not allow misinformation to win. Let us protect our children from preventable diseases. Let us vaccinate for life.

KWS said one component of the training — the NCO Promotion Course 1/2025 — will run from July 17 to October 10 and involve 176 participants.

The Junior Officers’ Course 1/2025, which began on July 4, will run until December 19 and will involve 103 participants.

The two programs will focus on enhancing command and leadership, tactical field operations, environmental law enforcement, climate-aware conservation strategies, and physical endurance.

The courses, KWS said, will to translate classroom instruction into real-world field readiness.

“These are not merely training programs or promotions. They are crucibles of transformation where Kenya’s next generation of conservation leaders is forged,” Kanga said.

"NIS, DCI officers linked to killing of Ruto campaign aides lose bid to halt trial","NAIROBI, Kenya, May 31 — The High Court in Kiambu has dismissed a petition filed by 13 police officers, a National Intelligence Service (NIS) officer, and a Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) warden seeking to stop prosecution in a high-profile murder case involving two Indian nationals and a Kenyan.

The prosecution accuses the officers of murdering Mohammed Zaid Sami Kidwai and Zulfiqar Ahmed Khan—Indian nationals who were part of President William Ruto’s 2022 digital campaign team—as well as Kenyan national Nicodemus Mwania Mwange.

Lady Justice Abigael Mshila ruled that the petition failed to meet the required legal threshold and dismissed it accordingly.

The fifteen security officers had moved to court in July last year to stop their prosecution, citing alleged abuse of power by the DPP and a violation of Article 157(11) of the Constitution.

They also sought to have the DPP’s decision to charge them nullified and any future prosecution barred.

However, the DPP, through a team of prosecutors — Everlyn Onunga, Augustine Gacharia, Allen Mulama, Kennedy Amwayi, and James Machirah — defended the decision, arguing evidence and investigative findings informed prosecution decisions.

The court rejected claims of constitutional violations.

Justice Mshila also clarified that the DPP retains discretion to withdraw charges in the lower courts through a nolle prosequi or under Section 87A of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Killer squad

The officers charged include Chief Inspector Peter Muthee Gachiko, Inspector James Kibosek, Corporals Joseph Kamau Mbugua, David Chepchieng, Joseph Mwenda, John Mwangi, and Hillary Limo; Constables Stephen Luseno, Simon Muhuga, Paul Njogu, Boniface Otieno, Elkana Njeru, and Fredrick Thuku; NIS officer John Wanjiku Macharia; and KWS warden Michael Kiplangat.

Kidwai, Khan and Mwange went missing in July 2022, with their deaths later linked to the now-disbanded Special Service Unit (SSU) of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI).

The alleged murders took place on the night of July 22–23, 2022, after members of security agencies picked them near Ole Sereni Hotel along Mombasa Road in Nairobi.

The accused, who pleaded not guilty, are also facing multiple charges before the Kahawa Law Courts, including abduction with intent to murder, conspiracy to commit a felony, subjecting persons to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and forgery of official documents.

At the time of the alleged crimes, the officers were attached to various state security agencies, with most serving in the disbanded SSU.

The court reffered the matter of bail and bondto Justice Olel for directions on July 21, 2025, with a ruling to be issued on notice.

Govt Unveils Tech-Driven Compensation Plan to Tackle Human-Wildlife Conflict,"NAIROBI, Kenya, May 7 – The government has unveiled a new digital compensation model designed to ease the burden of human-wildlife conflict on affected communities by streamlining payments, enhancing transparency, and accelerating claim resolution.

Tourism and Wildlife Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano said the system, already piloted in six counties, leverages real-time data collection, digital verification, and mobile money platforms like M-Pesa to facilitate quicker disbursement — especially for claims below Sh100,000.

“This marks a new era in compensating communities affected by wildlife. It’s a model rooted in transparency, equity, and powered by technology,” Miano said, emphasising the need for timely information and clear communication with the public.

So far, Sh10 million has been disbursed, with 804 pending claims worth Sh29.5 million awaiting payment. To support decentralised justice, County Wildlife Compensation Committees (CWCCs) have also been revived, enabling more responsive engagement with local communities.

The Ministry is set to roll out a countrywide compensation drive, with the main event scheduled for May 26 in Meru County.

In 2024, 7,883 human-wildlife conflict cases were reported — crop destruction leading, followed by livestock predation. Taita Taveta recorded the highest number of cases, trailed by Laikipia, Kajiado, Meru, and Marsabit.

Between 2022 and 2024, elephants were responsible for 17,917 incidents, including 7,556 crop damage cases, 149 injuries, and 121 deaths. Hyenas were cited in over 3,100 cases, primarily due to livestock attacks.

The Wildlife Conservation and Management Act (2013) provides for compensation, including Sh5 million for human death and Sh3 million for permanent disability, alongside market-rate payments for crop and livestock losses.

Since 2018, the government has paid out Sh4.8 billion in claims — Sh2.8 billion under the current administration. However, a backlog of 20,000 claims worth Sh1.36 billion still awaits resolution.

Court orders TSC to mediate with interdicted teachers who fled North Eastern,"NAIROBI, Kenya, Jul 21 — The Employment and Labour Relations Court has directed the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to enter into mediation talks with a group of interdicted teachers who fled North Eastern Kenya due to terror-related attacks.

The teachers, who had been posted to the region, were interdicted after abandoning their workstations following a series of deadly attacks linked to the Al-Shabaab militant group.

They later moved to court to challenge the disciplinary action taken against them.

Justice Byram Ongaya, presiding over the case at the Milimani Commercial Courts, issued the directive in a matter filed under the name Kethawa vs. Teachers Service Commission and State Law Office.

The court ordered that mediation between the TSC and the affected teachers should begin without delay.

“The cases be mentioned before the Deputy Registrar or Assistant Deputy Registrar on Monday… to identify an appropriate mediator for purposes of Court-Annexed Mediation,” ruled Justice Ongaya on Friday.

He further ordered that top TSC officials, including the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, attend the mediation sessions in person, alongside each of the affected teachers.

The mediation process is to be facilitated by a court-appointed mediator, who will be selected by Monday, July 21, 2025. The mediation is expected to conclude by September 1, 2025.

Justice Ongaya also directed the TSC to provide the venue for the mediation sessions and warned that failure by either party to comply with the court orders would attract punitive consequences.

The judge added that in the event the mediation efforts fail, the matter will be mentioned on October 22, 2025, for the court to record the outcomes and issue further directions.",https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2025/07/court-orders-tsc-to-mediate-with-interdicted-teachers-who-fled-north-eastern/,real
State seeks mental exam and 21-detention for KNH murder suspect,"NAIROBI, Kenya, July 21 – The State wants Kennedy Kalombotole, the prime suspect in the brutal murders of two patients at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), to undergo a mental examination.

The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) has also requested the court to allow police to detain the suspect for 21 more days pending the completion of investigations.

Prosecutors argued that the suspect might interfere with investigations and intimidate key witnesses if released.

“We are requesting for 21 days as the respondent has been a patient at KNH and currently has no place of abode. If released, he is likely to abscond, and we will not be able to trace him,” the Prosecutor told the court.

The ODPP added: “We are also apprehensive of his mental state, as he is believed to have been involved in several incidents at Kenyatta National Hospital. We require a secure facility to hold him, considering he has been identified as a person of interest in two murder cases.”

According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), Kalombotole was arrested in connection with the killing of Edward Maingi Ndegwa on July 17, 2025, and Gilbert Kinyua Muthoni, who was killed on February 25.

Preliminary investigations show Kalombotole had been admitted to KNH on December 1, 2024.

Ndegwa’s body was discovered by a cleaner conducting routine checks on July 17, who noticed blood oozing from the patient’s neck.

The DCI stated that investigators found blood-stained slippers at the scene, with blood trails leading from Ndegwa’s bedside to a nearby toilet and then to a side room where the suspect had been admitted.

“In the room, investigators recovered a pair of blue slippers and a blood-stained bedsheet,” the DCI said.

"DR Congo, M23 rebels sign deal in Qatar to end fighting in eastern Congo","The declaration has been agreed by representatives of both sides in Doha, weeks after talks in Washington.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the M23 rebel group have signed a declaration of principles in Qatar to end fighting in eastern Congo.

The declaration was signed on Saturday between representatives of both sides in Doha.

The DRC and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have been engaged in heavy fighting, spurred by M23’s bloody January assault and capture of the DRC’s two largest cities.

The decades-long conflict has roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, with M23 made up primarily of ethnic Tutsi fighters.

The Congolese fighting has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands more this year, while escalating the risk of a full-blown regional war.

Several of DRC’s neighbours already have troops deployed in the volatile region.

Al Jazeera’s Alain Uaykani, reporting from Goma in the DRC, said the development was significant for the people of the country. He said the situation had been “very unstable on the ground” before the agreement.

“The declaration signed today between the DR Congo government and M23 paves the way for a widespread discussion,” he added.

Uaykani underscored that M23 has said there should be trust between the sides to talk about the root causes of the conflict, and the deal might potentially establish that.

The African Union said the deal was a “significant development”.

“This … marks a major milestone in the ongoing efforts to achieve lasting peace, security, and stability in eastern DRC and the wider Great Lakes region,” AU chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said in a statement.

In March, Qatar brokered a surprise meeting between DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame, during which they called for an “immediate and unconditional” ceasefire.

That led to direct talks, also in Doha, between the DRC and M23.

The DRC had previously rejected the idea of holding talks with M23, branding it a “terrorist group”, but in April, both sides pledged to work towards a ceasefire.

The deal does not address important questions concerning the possible Rwandan and M23 withdrawals from eastern DR Congo.

It says DR Congo and M23 agree state authority should be restored “on all national territories” as part of an eventual peace agreement but does not give details.

Government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya nevertheless said on X on Saturday that the declaration “takes into account the red lines we have always defended, including the non-negotiable withdrawal” of M23.

Negotiations for a peace agreement are to start no later than August 8, according to the declaration, which would give the parties less than two weeks to finalise a deal if they stick to their new August 18 deadline.

Talks in the US

Washington has also hosted talks between the DRC and Rwanda in June.

On June 27, the two countries’ foreign ministers signed a peace deal and met with United States President Donald Trump at the White House. Trump warned of “very severe penalties, financial and otherwise” if the deal is violated.

Trump had also invited Tshisekedi and Kagame to Washington to sign a package of deals that Massad Boulos, Trump’s senior adviser for Africa, dubbed the “Washington Accord”.

But he had also said US officials hope to have a deal in Doha finalised by then.

The DRC, the United Nations and Western powers say Rwanda is supporting M23 by sending troops and arms.

Rwanda has long denied helping M23 and says its forces are acting in self-defence against the DRC’s army and ethnic Hutu fighters linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/19/dr-congo-m23-rebels-sign-deal-in-qatar-to-end-fighting-in-eastern-congo,real
Italy cancels concert by Putin ally Gergiev,"Italy’s Royal Palace of Caserta has announced it cancelled a concert by Russian maestro Valery Gergiev, a vocal backer of President Vladimir Putin, after an uproar from politicians and Kremlin critics.

The concert scheduled for Sunday in the 18th-century palace near Naples caused a heated debate in Italy, was slammed by Ukraine and led to calls for protests by Russia’s exiled opposition.

Gergiev has not condemned Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, a stance for which he was fired from the Munich Philharmonic in March 2022. He has since been shunned by the West and has not played concerts in Europe.

Days of uncertainty over the concert ended with the abrupt announcement on Monday.

“The directorate of the Royal Palace of Caserta has ordered the cancellation of the symphony concert conducted by Valery Gergiev, scheduled as part of the Un’Estate da Re festival for July 27,” said a Caserta palace statement.

It gave no official reason for the decision.

Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, lauded the announcement as “good news”.

“No artist who supports the current dictatorship in Russia should be welcomed in Europe,” Navalnaya wrote on X.

Navalnaya’s team had campaigned against the concert and said in a statement: “Putin’s pals should not be touring Europe like nothing happened.”

Russia’s state TASS news agency said the 72-year-old maestro was not informed of the decision, quoting Gergiev as saying: “I do not have this information.”

‘Scandalous situation’

Gergiev is the director of Russia’s Bolshoi and Mariinsky theatres, and before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he regularly played in leading Western theatres.

While Kremlin critics lauded the cancellation, Moscow’s ambassador to Italy called it a “scandalous situation” that was part of Western politicians’ “policy of ‘cancelling’ Russian culture”.

In a statement on the embassy’s Facebook page, Alexei Paramonov said it was “sad” to watch Italy “subordinate its cultural policy to the demands of Ukrainians and other immigrants”.

Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli – who had warned that the concert risked turning into a propaganda event – said the cancellation was “common sense” and aimed at “protecting the values of the free world”.

Ukraine on Sunday urged organisers to drop the performance, calling Gergiev “Putin’s mouthpiece” who should not be welcomed anywhere “as long as Russian forces continue to commit atrocities” in Ukraine.

Recognised as one of the world’s leading orchestra leaders, Gergiev is known for conducting epic symphonies of Russian classical music by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, among other successes in Western opera houses.

Pakistan arrests 13 suspects as ‘honour killing’ video goes viral,"Thirteen arrested in Balochistan province for alleged involvement in the killing of a couple ordered by a tribal leader.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistani authorities have arrested at least 13 individuals, including a tribal leader, in connection with the killing of a couple in the southwestern province of Balochistan.

The arrests followed nationwide outrage over a video depicting the murders went viral on social media, with many calling it yet another case of “honour killing” – a phenomenon reported from across South Asia.

The first information report (FIR) filed by the police on Monday identifies the couple as Bano Bibi and her husband Ehsan Ullah, and says they were likely killed in May near Balochistan’s capital Quetta.

Honour killings, mainly reported from Pakistan and India, often arise from perceived family, tribal or caste dishonour, especially in love marriages, in which the two partners marry without the consent of their families or tribe, or elope. Many such killings go unreported.

Balochistan police official Syed Suboor Agha told Al Jazeera they are investigating the matter and are likely to make more arrests, including Bano’s brother, who is suspected of the murders and “is still at large”.

The viral videos of the killings show a group of armed men gathered around vehicles in a deserted area. Bano is ordered by the crowd to stand away from the vehicles as the couple is pumped with bullets, even on their motionless bodies lying bleeding on the sand.

The FIR names eight suspects while also listing 15 other unidentified suspects involved in the incident.

According to the FIR, the couple was allegedly brought before local tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Khan, who declared them guilty of engaging in an “immoral relationship” and ordered that they be killed.

‘Tyranny of medieval practices’

Pakistan has a dismal record on “honour killings” and other forms of violence against women.

According to Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO), an Islamabad-based independent organisation, more than 32,000 cases of gender-based violence were reported nationwide in 2024, including 547 instances of “honour killings” – 32 of them in Balochistan and only one resulting in conviction.

Harris Khalique, general secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the country’s leading rights watchdog, said the killings in the name of honour confirm the “tyranny of medieval practices” still entrenched in many parts of Pakistan.

“The state, instead of establishing the rule of law and ensure the right to life of its citizens, has protected the tribal chiefs and feudal lords who guard such practices to perpetuate their power over local people and resources,” Khalique told Al Jazeera.

Mineral-rich Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest but least populous province, has also witnessed decades of conflict between the government and ethnic Baloch separatists, who demand secession from the country.

Rights activist Sammi Deen Baloch, also a member of a Baloch women’s rights group, said killing of women has become “a matter of routine” in the province.

“In Balochistan, women are murdered for love, disappeared for protest, and buried under layers of tribal authority and state-backed silence. These are not isolated tragedies. They are the cost of a system designed to keep Balochistan obedient, and its women expendable,” she told Al Jazeera.

Baloch said the government would not have acted on the murders had the video not gone viral.

“Baloch women are trapped between two forms of violence: the brutality of tribal patriarchy, and the cold repression of the state. One kills in silence, the other kills in the name of law,” she said.

“The state’s refusal to democratise Balochistan isn’t accidental. It is policy. By outsourcing governance to feudal strongmen, the state keeps the region controlled, its women disposable, and its dissent criminal.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/21/pakistan-arrests-over-a-dozen-suspects-as-honour-killing-video-goes-viral,real
Lawyers ask that Kilmar Abrego Garcia stay in jail to avoid US deportation,"Despite being wrongly deported and returned to the US, lawyers say Abrego Garcia again faces expulsion.

Lawyers representing Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a judge in Tennessee to delay his release from jail, in a bid to avoid deportation.

The filing on Monday was the latest turn in the case of Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to his native El Salvador by the administration of President Donald Trump in March, but later returned to the US in June following a Supreme Court order.

Abrego Garcia has been held in jail since his return, as he faces smuggling charges related to a 2022 traffic stop.

His lawyers have dismissed the charges as “preposterous” and an effort by US officials to demonise Abrego Garcia, who has become a cause celebre for opponents of Trump’s mass deportation drive.

At the same time, they believe that if Abrego Garcia is released ahead of his trial, he will be detained by immigration agents and deported, according to the Monday filing.

They requested that any release of Abrego Garcia be delayed by 30 days so he can “evaluate his options and determine whether additional relief is necessary”.

US District Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr is expected to soon rule on whether to free Abrego Garcia, after another judge ruled he could be released as he did not pose a flight risk.

Plan to deport

The Trump administration has long maintained that Abrego Garcia, a resident of Maryland, was a member of an MS-13 gang, a claim his lawyers have said was based on faulty information.

Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime or had the claims adjudicated in court.

He was among those loaded onto a deportation flight to El Salvador under the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act, which the Trump administration has argued allows for the swift deportation of alleged gang members.

Administration officials later admitted that Abrego Garcia had been wrongly deported due to an “administrative error”, as an immigration judge in 2019 had shielded Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador. The judge determined he faces threats of gang violence in his home country.

Still, for several months, the administration refused to return Abrego Garcia, who came to the US in 2011 without documentation.

Trump officials have since said that the immigration judge’s 2019 order only applies to El Salvador, and have maintained that they can legally deport Abrego Garcia to a third country.

Last month, the US Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration could deport individuals to far-flung third countries, including war-torn South Sudan, until a legal challenge to the practice makes its way through the lower courts.

Abrego Garcia’s wife, meanwhile, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in Maryland. His lawyers have requested that he be transferred to state custody while the criminal and civil cases proceed.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/21/lawyers-ask-that-kilmar-abrego-garcia-stay-in-jail-to-avoid-us-deportation,real
Belgian police question Israelis over alleged Gaza war crimes,"Belgian authorities have interrogated two members of the Israeli military following allegations of serious breaches of international humanitarian law committed in Gaza, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office in Brussels said.

The two people were questioned after legal complaints were filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation and the Global Legal Action Network. The complaints were submitted on Friday and Saturday as the soldiers attended the Tomorrowland music festival in Belgium.

“In light of this potential jurisdiction, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office requested the police to locate and interrogate the two individuals named in the complaint,” said the prosecutor’s office in a written statement on Monday. “Following these interrogations, they were released.”

The questioning was carried out under a new provision in Belgium’s Code of Criminal Procedure, which came into effect last year. It allows Belgian courts to investigate alleged violations abroad if the acts fall under international treaties ratified by Belgium – including the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture.

The prosecutor’s office said it would not release further information at this stage of the investigation.

The Hind Rajab Foundation, based in Belgium, has been campaigning for legal action against Israeli soldiers over alleged war crimes in Gaza. It is named after a six-year-old Palestinian girl who was killed by Israeli fire while fleeing Gaza City with her family early in Israel’s war on Gaza.

Since its formation last year, the foundation has filed dozens of complaints in more than 10 countries, targeting both low- and high-ranking Israeli military personnel.

The group hailed Monday’s developments as “a turning point in the global pursuit of accountability”.

“We will continue to support the ongoing proceedings and call on Belgian authorities to pursue the investigation fully and independently,” the foundation said in a statement. “Justice must not stop here – and we are committed to seeing it through.”

“At a time when far too many governments remain silent, this action sends a clear message: credible evidence of international crimes must be met with legal response – not political indifference,” the statement added.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry confirmed the incident, saying that one Israeli citizen and one soldier were interrogated and later released. “Israeli authorities dealt with this issue and are in touch with the two,” the ministry said in a statement cited by The Associated Press news agency.

The incident comes amid growing international outrage over Israel’s conduct in its war on Gaza. More than two dozen Western countries called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza on Monday, saying that suffering there had “reached new depths”.

After more than 21 months of fighting that have triggered catastrophic humanitarian conditions for Gaza’s more than two million people, Israeli allies Britain, France, Australia, Canada and 21 other countries, plus the European Union, said in a joint statement that the war “must end now”.

“The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths,” the signatories added, urging a negotiated ceasefire, the release of captives held by Palestinian armed groups and the free flow of much-needed aid.

On Sunday, the World Food Programme accused Israel of using tanks, snipers and other weapons to fire on a crowd of Palestinians seeking food aid.

It said that shortly after crossing through the northern Zikim crossing into Gaza, its 25-truck convoy encountered large crowds of civilians waiting for food supplies, who were attacked.

“As the convoy approached, the surrounding crowd came under fire from Israeli tanks, snipers and other gunfire,” it said on X, adding that the incident resulted in the loss of “countless lives” with many more suffering critical injuries.

“These people were simply trying to access food to feed themselves and their families on the brink of starvation. This terrible incident underscores the increasingly dangerous conditions under which humanitarian operations are forced to be conducted in Gaza.”

Gaza’s Health Ministry described the Israeli attack, which killed at least 92 people, as one of the war’s deadliest days for civilians seeking humanitarian assistance.

More than 59,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its war on Gaza in October 2023, according to local health officials. Much of the territory lies in ruins, with severe shortages of food, medicine and other essentials due to Israel’s ongoing blockade.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/21/belgian-police-question-israelis-over-alleged-gaza-war-crimes,real
Philippines’ Marcos to meet Trump seeking trade deal,"Leaders expected to hold talks on bilateral trade days before US tariffs on Philippine goods set to take effect.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr will meet United States President Donald Trump this week, hoping Manila’s status as a key Asian ally will secure a more favourable trade deal.

Marcos will be the first Southeast Asian leader to meet Trump during the US leader’s second term.

Trump has already struck trade deals with two of Manila’s regional partners, Vietnam and Indonesia, driving tough bargains in negotiations even with close allies that Washington wants to keep onside in its strategic rivalry with China.

“I expect our discussions to focus on security and defence, of course, but also on trade,” Marcos said in a speech before leaving Manila and arriving in Washington on Sunday, with hopes to reach a deal before August 1, when Trump says he will impose 20 percent tariffs on goods from the Philippines.

“We will see how much progress we can make when it comes to the negotiations with the United States concerning the changes that we would like to institute to alleviate the effects of a very severe tariff schedule on the Philippines,” Marcos said.

The US had a deficit of nearly $5bn with the Philippines last year on bilateral goods trade of $23.5bn.

Trump this month raised the threatened “reciprocal” tariffs on imports from the Philippines to 20 percent from 17 percent threatened in April.

Although US allies in Asia such as Japan and South Korea have yet to strike trade deals with Trump, Gregory Poling, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Marcos might be able to do better than Vietnam, with its agreement of a 20 percent baseline tariff on its goods, and Indonesia at 19 percent.

“I wouldn’t be surprised to see an announcement of a deal with the Philippines at a lower rate than those two,” Poling told the Reuters news agency.

Marcos visited the Pentagon on Monday morning for talks with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and will see Secretary of State Marco Rubio later in the day, before meeting Trump at the White House on Tuesday.

He will also meet US business leaders investing in the Philippines.

Philippine officials say Marcos’s focus will be on economic cooperation and Manila’s concerns about Trump’s tariffs.

They say he will stress that Manila must become economically stronger if it is to serve as a truly robust US partner in the Asia Pacific.

Philippine Assistant Foreign Secretary Raquel Solano said last week that trade officials have been working with US counterparts seeking to seal a “mutually acceptable and mutually beneficial” deal for both countries.

China tensions

Trump and Marcos will also discuss defence and security, and Solano said the Philippine president would be looking to further strengthen the longstanding defence alliance.

Philippine media quoted Manila’s ambassador to Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, as saying on Sunday that the visit would see a reaffirmation of the seven-decade-old mutual defence treaty and “discussions on how we can continue to cooperate with the United States, our major ally”.

With the Philippines facing intense pressure from China in the contested South China Sea, Marcos has pivoted closer to the US, expanding access to Philippine military bases amid China’s threats towards Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by Beijing.

The US and the Philippines hold dozens of annual exercises, which have included training with the US Typhon missile system, and more recently, with the NMESIS antiship missile system, angering China.

Manila and the US have closely aligned their views on China, Poling said, and it was notable that Rubio and Hegseth made sure their Philippine counterparts were the first Southeast Asian officials they met.

Poling said Trump also seemed to have a certain warmth towards Marcos, based on their phone call after Trump’s re-election.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/21/philippines-marcos-to-meet-trump-seeking-trade-deal,real
"Ecuador’s biggest drug lord ‘Fito’ extradited to US, to plead ‘not guilty’","Adolfo Macias, who was recaptured in June after escaping from a prison last year, will appear in a New York state court on Monday.

Ecuadorean gang leader Adolfo Macias Villamar, also known as “Fito”, is set to appear in a federal court in the United States, where he will plead not guilty to international charges of drug and weapons trafficking, his lawyer says.

The Ecuadorean government on Sunday extradited the notorious drug trafficker, a month after he was recaptured following a 2024 escape from a maximum-security penitentiary, the country’s prison authority said.

Macias, the leader of the Los Choneros gang, was serving a 34-year sentence at a prison in Guayaquil for a slew of crimes, including drug trafficking, organised crime, and murder.

The flight transporting Macias landed in New York state on Sunday night, the report said. His lawyer told the Reuters news agency that Macias “will plead not guilty” before the Brooklyn federal court on Monday.

Details of the handover to the US government and the extradition were not specified. The US government has yet to issue an official statement following the extradition.

The US Attorney’s Office had filed charges in April against Macias on suspicion of cocaine distribution, conspiracy and firearms violations, including weapons smuggling.

The former taxi driver turned crime boss agreed in a Quito court last week to be extradited to the US to face the charges.

He is the first Ecuadorean extradited by his country since a new measure was written into law last year, after a referendum in which President Daniel Noboa sought the approval of moves to boost his war on criminal gangs.

Ecuador, once a peaceful haven between the world’s two top cocaine exporters, Colombia and Peru, has seen violence erupt in recent years as rival gangs with ties to Mexican and Colombian cartels vie for control.

Cult following

Soon after Macias escaped from prison in January 2024, Noboa declared Ecuador to be in a state of “internal armed conflict” and ordered the military and tanks into the streets to “neutralise” the gangs. The move has been criticised by human rights organisations.

As a drug lord, Macias cultivated a cult status among fellow gang members and the public.

While behind bars in 2023, he released a video addressed to “the Ecuadorian people” while flanked by armed men. He also threw parties in prison, where he had access to everything from liquor to roosters for cockfighting matches.

Macias’s Los Choneros has ties to Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, Colombia’s Gulf Clan, which is considered the world’s largest cocaine exporter, as well as Balkan mafias, according to the Ecuadorian Organised Crime Observatory.

His escape from prison prompted widespread violence and a massive military and police recapture operation, including government “wanted” posters offering $1m for information leading to his arrest.

On June 25, Macias was found hiding in a bunker concealed under floor tiles in a luxury home in the fishing port of Manta, the centre of operations for Los Choneros. Noboa declared he would be extradited, “the sooner the better”.

“We will gladly send him and let him answer to the North American law,” Noboa told CNN at the time.

In 2024, the country seized a record 294 tonnes of drugs, mainly cocaine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/21/ecuadors-biggest-drug-lord-fito-extradited-to-us-to-plead-not-guilty,real
"Climate crisis causing food price spikes around the world, scientists say","South Korean cabbage, Australian lettuce, Japanese rice, Brazilian coffee and Ghanaian cocoa are among the many foods that have been hit by price hikes following extreme climate events since 2022, a team of international scientists has found.

The research released on Monday cites, among other examples, a 280 percent spike in global cocoa prices in April 2024, following a heatwave in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, and a 300 percent jump in lettuce prices in Australia after floods in 2022.

In the vast majority of cases, the increase in prices came soon after heatwaves, including a 70 percent increase in cabbage prices in South Korea in September 2024, a 48 percent increase in rice prices in Japan in September 2024, and an 81 percent increase in potato prices in India in early 2024.

Other price increases were linked to drought, such as a 2023 drought in Brazil that preceded a 55 percent increase in global coffee prices the following year, and a 2022 drought in Ethiopia that came before overall food prices there increased by 40 percent in 2023.

The research, published by six European research organisations along with the European Central Bank, was released before the United Nations Food Systems Summit, which will be co-hosted by Ethiopia and Italy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from July 27 to July 29.

“Until we get to net zero emissions extreme weather will only get worse, but it’s already damaging crops and pushing up the price of food all over the world,” the report’s lead author, Maximillian Kotz, from the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, said in a press release.

“People are noticing, with rising food prices number two on the list of climate impacts they see in their lives, second only to extreme heat itself,” Kotz added, noting that low-income families are often the most affected when “the price of food shoots up”.

The report comes as the cost of living, including food affordability, has been a key issue for many voters heading to elections around the world in recent years, including in Japan, where the price of rice was on many voters’ minds as they headed to the polls this weekend.

Grocery prices were also key election issues in the United States and the United Kingdom in 2024 and in Argentina in 2023.

“In the UK, climate change added £360 [$482] to the average household food bill across 2022 and 2023 alone,” one of the report’s co-authors, Amber Sawyer, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said in a press release.

“Last year, the UK had its third worst arable harvest on record, and England its second worst, following extreme rainfall that scientists said was made worse by climate change,” she added.

Under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), governments have committed to cutting the global emissions that are driving the climate crisis by 2.6 percent from 2019 to 2030.

However, these commitments fall well short of the reductions scientists say are needed to stay within reach of a Paris Agreement target to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is expected to deliver a landmark advisory opinion on states’ legal obligations to address climate change on Wednesday, in a case brought by Vanuatu and backed by many Global South countries.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/21/climate-crisis-causing-food-price-spikes-around-the-world-scientists-say,real
At least 65 killed in Gaza attacks as Israel sends tanks into Deir el-Balah,"Israeli military sends tanks into parts of city in central Gaza for first time since it launched the war on Gaza in October 2023.

At least 65 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza, medical sources say, as the Israeli military sent tanks into areas of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza for the first time since Israel began its assault on the besieged territory in October 2023.

Israel on Monday launched the ground offensive on southern and eastern areas of the city that is packed with displaced Palestinians, a day after its military issued a forced displacement order for residents in the areas, forcing thousands of people to flee west towards the Mediterranean coast and south to Khan Younis.

Tank shelling in the area hit houses and mosques, killing at least three Palestinians and wounding several, the Reuters news agency reported, quoting local medics.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said gunfire was audible as Israeli tanks rolled into the area on Monday morning.

“We can see that the entire city is under Israeli attack,” he said. “We did not manage to sleep last night.”

“There has been an ongoing Israeli bombardment. Israeli jets, tanks and naval gunboats continue to strike multiple residential areas. Three more squares were destroyed in the city, and then residential houses were flattened.”

He said many Deir el-Balah residents fled using donkey carts and other modes of transport.

United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said two UN guesthouses in the city were “struck, despite parties having been informed of the locations of UN premises, which are inviolable. These locations – as with all civilian sites – must be protected, regardless of evacuation orders.”

The World Health Organization said its staff residence and main warehouse in Deir el-Balah was attacked on Monday.

Two WHO staff and two family members were detained by the Israeli military, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding that three were later released while one staff member remained in detention.

Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, says the forced displacement threat that preceded the Israeli army’s ground invasion of Deir el-Balah has already displaced up to 80,000 Palestinians.

The Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said it ambushed invading Israeli troops in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza.

Fighters detonated a “powerful landmine” in the Umm Dhahir area south of the city as a Merkava tank advanced, it said in a short statement. It is unclear if there were any casualties.

Israel intensifies attacks

Medical sources told Al Jazeera that at least 65 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Monday, including 11 aid seekers.

In Khan Younis in southern Gaza, an Israeli air strike killed at least five people, including a husband and wife and their two children, in a tent, medics said.

Five other Palestinians were killed in a separate Israeli bombardment in Jabalia al-Balad in the north.

Earlier, the Palestine Red Crescent Society reported that its teams had recovered the body of one person and evacuated three wounded after an Israeli artillery strike on the nearby Jabalia al-Nazla area.

Drone strikes were reported in Gaza City, resulting in casualties, a source at al-Shifa Hospital told Al Jazeera Arabic.

The previous day, at least 134 people were killed and 1,155 injured by Israeli forces, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. At least 59,029 people in Gaza have been killed since the war began.

On Sunday, Gaza health authorities reported at least 19 people had starved to death in one day, highlighting the desperate situation under the Israeli aid blockade.

In an interview with Al Jazeera, the World Food Programme’s Palestine representative, Antoine Renard, said the United Nations agency has warned for “weeks” that Palestinians in Gaza are facing starvation.

“You have a level of despair that people are ready to risk their lives just to reach any of the assistance actually coming into Gaza,” Renard said from occupied East Jerusalem.

“[There’s a] soaring number of people facing malnutrition, and we can really see that the situation is really getting to levels that we’ve never seen ever before.”

UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said it is receiving “desperate messages of starvation” from inside Gaza, including from its staff, as humanitarian conditions continue to deteriorate.

“The suffering in Gaza is manmade and must be stopped. Lift the siege and let aid in safely and at scale,” UNRWA said in a statement posted on X.

Amjad Shawa, head of the Palestinian NGO Network, told Al Jazeera on Monday that 900,000 children are experiencing varying degrees of malnutrition in Gaza.

Twenty-five countries, including the United Kingdom, France and other European nations, issued a joint statement saying the war in Gaza “must end now” and Israel must comply with international law.

The foreign ministers of the 25 countries, including Australia, Canada and Japan, said “the suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths”, and they condemned “the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food”.

“The Israeli government’s aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity,” the statement said.

“The Israeli government’s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable. Israel must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law,” it said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/21/at-least-49-killed-in-gaza-attacks-as-israel-sends-tanks-into-deir-el-balah,real
Barcelona sign Marcus Rashford from Manchester United on loan,"Barcelona’s already impressive front line is about to be boosted by the signing of Marcus Rashford.

Rashford is in Barcelona to complete a move from Manchester United, a person with knowledge of the transfer told The Associated Press news agency on Monday.

The person was not authorised to speak about the transfer publicly and did not want to be named.

The loan deal would give the 27-year-old England forward, once considered among Europe’s top talents, a chance to revive a career that has stalled in recent years after he fell out of favour at United and ended last season on loan at Aston Villa.

Spanish media said the one-year loan would give Barcelona an option to buy Rashford for about $35m.

Barcelona had the best attack in Spanish football and one of the most prolific across Europe last season but had been trying to add another piece to the front line to go along with young star Lamine Yamal, Raphinha and veteran Robert Lewandowski.

Rashford has spent his entire career at United, scoring 138 goals in 429 appearances and winning five major trophies, including two FA Cups and the Europa League.

But he struggled to consistently live up to the hype that surrounded him when he burst onto the scene as a teenager in 2016 – managing 20 goals or more only in three seasons. In his past two seasons at United, he scored a combined 15 goals and added another four in 17 games on loan at Villa.

The Catalan club also led the Champions League in goals with 43, five more than champion Paris Saint-Germain, before being eliminated by Inter Milan in the semifinals.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/21/barcelona-sign-rashford-from-man-utd-on-loan,real
Man Utd close on Mbeumo deal with medical imminent,"Manchester United are on the verge of signing Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with a medical understood to be imminent.

Manchester United have reportedly agreed to sign Cameroon winger Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal worth an initial $87m as Ruben Amorim steps up his overhaul of the team’s misfiring attack.

Mbeumo attracted Amorim’s attention with 20 goals in 38 Premier League games for Brentford last season.

Tottenham, now managed by former Brentford boss Thomas Frank, were also chasing the 25-year-old before United’s improved offer sealed the deal after their two previous bids were rebuffed.

United will pay an additional 6 million pounds ($8.07m) in potential add-ons to Brentford.

Mbeumo is due to undergo a medical in time to travel to the United States on Tuesday as Amorim’s men start their pre-season tour.

He is set to become United’s third signing since the end of last season, joining Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and teenage Paraguayan defender Diego Leon at Old Trafford.

Amorim has been determined to revamp United’s forward options after a woeful campaign.

They suffered a toothless 1-0 defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final and a 15th-place finish in the top flight that ranked as their lowest since 1973-74.

Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee struggled as Amorim’s main strikers last term.

Amorim has reportedly told Alejandro Garnacho to look for a new club, while Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are expected to leave following their loan spells at Aston Villa and Chelsea, respectively.

Mbeumo will be Amorim’s latest new recruit in his bid to revitalise moribund United.

Having already paid 62.5 million pounds ($84.03m) for Cunha, United’s spending spree comes despite their failure to qualify for the Champions League costing the club a minimum of 70 million pounds ($94.11m).

The versatile Mbeumo is able to operate in a variety of roles on the flanks or in central attacking areas.

His pace, creativity and clinical finishing should be a significant boost to United.

Mbeumo blossomed in six years at Brentford, scoring 70 goals and providing 51 assists in 242 appearances in all competitions following his move from French club Troyes in 2019.

He helped the Bees win promotion to the Premier League in 2021 and was instrumental in their impressive 10th-place finish in 2024-25.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/18/man-utd-close-on-mbeumo-deal-with-medical-imminent,real
Manchester United: Cantona claims Ratcliffe is destroying club,"Former Manchester United star Eric Cantona has accused co-owner Jim Ratcliffe and his lieutenants of destroying the Old Trafford club.

British billionaire Ratcliffe has endured a turbulent spell since taking charge of United’s football operations after buying a minority share in February 2024.

The INEOS owner has sacked boss Erik ten Hag and replaced him with Ruben Amorim, with little improvement as the team languishes in 13th place in the Premier League.

Ratcliffe, a boyhood United fan, has also raised ticket prices and undertook drastic cost-cutting measures, resulting in about 450 lost jobs, while launching a plan to build a new 100,000-capacity stadium.

A United legend after helping the club end their long wait to win the English title in 1993, Cantona is not impressed with Ratcliffe’s impact on his former team.

“Since Ratcliffe arrived, this team of directors try to destroy everything and they don’t respect anybody,” Cantona told reporters during an event at FC United, the non-league team started by fans in 2005 as a response to the controversial takeover by the Glazer family, who remain the majority shareholders.

“They even want to change the stadium. The soul of the team and the club is not in the players. All the people around is like a big family. It’s very important to respect these people like you respect your manager and teammates.

“Since Ratcliffe arrived, it’s the complete opposite. He doesn’t want Sir Alex Ferguson as an ambassador any more. He is more than a legend and I think we have to find this soul again.”

Former France striker Cantona, who has signed up to become an FC United co-owner, spent five years at United after Alex Ferguson signed him from Leeds, winning four Premier League titles and two FA Cups.

The 58-year-old believes leaving Old Trafford would be a big mistake, because the soul of the club is tied to the stadium that has been its home since 1910.

“This team of directors, they try to destroy everything. They don’t respect anybody. They even want to change the stadium. The stadium is iconic,” he said.

“For me, Arsenal lost their soul when they left Highbury, and I’m sure a lot of fans miss Highbury. I don’t think United can play in another stadium than Old Trafford.”

Cantona, who now works as an actor, revealed he offered to help Ratcliffe rebuild a club that has not won the Premier League since Alex Ferguson’s final season in charge in 2013.

“Until the end of October this year, I will shoot movies,” he said. “But I said to them, ‘I can put that aside and concentrate and help you to rebuild something’. And they don’t care.

“I feel sad to see United in this kind of situation. They decided something else. They have another strategy, another project.

“I support United because I really love United, but now, if I was a fan and I had to choose a club, I don’t think I would choose United. Because I don’t feel close to these kind of decisions.

“I think maybe we are dreamers and the owners are more like an economy and a strategy. I hate this kind of thing. I hate this kind of decision.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/4/10/manchester-united-cantona-claims-ratcliffe-is-destroying-club,real
"Marc Marquez wins Czech MotoGP in Brno, extends championship lead","Six-time MotoGP world champ continues his supreme 2025 season, becoming first Ducati rider to win five consecutive GPs.

Marc Marquez has won the Czech MotoGP for his eighth victory in 12 races this season and his fifth in a row, extending his commanding lead in the world championship.

The factory Ducati rider beat Marco Bezzecchi on an Aprilia by almost two seconds on Sunday while Pedro Acosta on a KTM came in third in his first podium finish of the season.

Marquez had a fifth straight perfect weekend, winning both the sprint on Saturday and Sunday’s race.

The 32-year-old Spaniard now leads the world championship with 381 points, 120 ahead of his younger brother, Alex, who crashed, and 168 ahead of Ducati teammate Francesco Bagnaia.

“It has been a super first part of the season and especially these last races,” Marc Marquez said.

“I feel better and better, and I’m riding super good,” he added.

Marquez outpaces his rivals

Bagnaia started from pole on a sunny Sunday at Brno but retained the lead only until the second lap when Bezzecchi eased past him, and Marc Marquez followed suit soon afterwards.

Acosta did the same to settle down in third after getting a boost from a third-place finish in Saturday’s sprint.

Marquez glided past Bezzecchi on lap eight as the runaway trio kept building up their lead and, as so often this season, kept widening the gap comfortably.

The three stayed put until the finish line although fourth-placed Bagnaia gave Acosta a hard time, pressing from behind.

“The first lap was unbelievable,” Bezzecchi said.

“I had so much fun in the first half of the race, but unfortunately, when Marc passed me, I immediately saw that he had something more.”

“I tried to attack, but he was strong. Anyway, I made a fantastic performance. I’m very, very happy,” the Italian added.

Reigning world champion Jorge Martin collected his first points after finishing seventh in the first race he has completed this year.

Martin sat out the first three races after two preseason crashes, and when he returned at Qatar in April, he crashed heavily again and missed the next seven events.

Brno returns faster than ever

Marc Marquez took 40 minutes 04.628 seconds to complete the 21 laps on the resurfaced 5.4km (3.4-mile) Brno circuit, which returned to the MotoGP calendar after a five-year break due to financial woes.

The enhanced on-track results of the Brno resurfacing were evident with lap times this year several seconds under the previous lap record.

Bezzecchi crossed the line 1.753 seconds adrift of Marquez, while Acosta trailed the six-time MotoGP champion by 3.366 seconds.

Almost 220,000 fans were in the stands for the weekend as Marquez recorded his fourth MotoGP win at Brno after victories in 2013, 2017 and 2019.

Alex Marquez retired after crashing on lap two to leave Brno without a point after a disappointing 17th spot in the sprint race.

He took out Joan Mir, who also walked away from the gravel safety area, just like Enea Bastianini a lap later.

Japan’s Takaaki Nakagami was ruled out of the race after suffering a knee injury in a crash in Saturday’s sprint.

The MotoGP circus will now take a break and resume with the Austrian GP on August 15-17.

“Now it’s the summer break but still 10 races to go. Time to relax, but in Austria I [will] keep the same mentality with the same intensity,” Marc Marquez said.

He is eyeing his seventh MotoGP world title – and first since 2019 – which would put him level with Valentino Rossi and one behind the legendary Giacomo Agostini.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/20/marc-marquez-wins-czech-motogp-in-brno-extends-championship-lead,real
"Manny Pacquiao, Mario Barrios fight to majority draw","The 46-year old’s comeback bid for 13th world title falls short with a draw against WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios.

Manny Pacquiao’s bid to become the oldest welterweight champion in boxing history fell short as he failed to beat Mario Barrios at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

But he did not lose, either.

Recommended Stories list of 1 item list 1 of 1 Usyk knocks out Dubois in fifth to become undisputed heavyweight champion end of list

Instead, the 46-year-old Pacquiao and the 30-year-old Barrios fought to a majority draw on Saturday, with one judge giving Barrios a 115-113 win and the other two judges scoring it a 114-114 draw.

The result allowed Barrios (29-2-2, 18 knockouts) to retain his WBC welterweight belt.

“I thought I won the fight,” Pacquiao said afterwards.

“I mean, it was a close fight. My opponent was very tough. It was a wonderful fight. It was good.”

Pacquiao (62-8-3, 39 KOs) already holds the record for the oldest welterweight champion, winning the belt via split-decision over Keith Thurman in 2019.

The Filipino legend was enshrined in the International Boxing Hall of Fame last month. Pacquiao dominated Saturday’s fight early on, showing energy against his younger foe.

Ultimately, though, CompuBox stats had Barrios landing more punches (120-101) and more jabs (45-20), though Pacquiao landed 81 power punches to Barrios’s 75.

Pacquiao held the lead on all three cards after 10 rounds, but Barrios took all three rounds on all three scorecards to avoid the upset. Age and stamina were definitely on Pacquiao’s mind after the fight.

“I need to continue my training for longer going into a championship fight,” said Pacquiao, who lost his senatorial bid in the Philippines in May. “Because of the election, I started late, but it’s OK. Of course, I’d like a rematch. I want to leave a legacy and make the Filipino people proud.

“Don’t tell that to Barrios.

“His stamina is crazy,” the champion said. “He’s still strong as hell, and his timing is real. He’s still a very awkward fighter to try to figure out.”

As for a rematch, Barrios is ready.

“I’ll do the rematch. Absolutely. This was huge for boxing. I’d love to do it again.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/20/manny-pacquiao-mario-barrios-fight-to-majority-draw,real
Iran to hold nuclear talks with 3 European powers on Friday,"China, France, Germany, Russia and the UK are the remaining parties to a 2015 nuclear deal reached with Iran.

Iran, France, Germany and the United Kingdom will hold nuclear talks in Istanbul following warnings by the three European countries that failure to resume negotiations would lead to international sanctions being reimposed on Tehran.

The talks scheduled for Friday come after foreign ministers of the E3 nations, as those European countries are known, as well as the European Union’s foreign policy chief, held their first call on Thursday with Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi since Israel and the United States attacked Iranian nuclear facilities a month ago.

The three European countries, along with China and Russia, are the remaining parties to a 2015 nuclear deal reached with Iran, from which the US withdrew in 2018, that had lifted sanctions on the Middle Eastern country in return for restrictions on its nuclear programme.

“The meeting between Iran, Britain, France and Germany will take place at the deputy foreign minister level,” Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Esmaeil Baghaei, was quoted by Iranian state media as saying.

The E3 have said they would restore United Nations sanctions on Tehran by the end of August if nuclear talks that were ongoing between Iran and the US, before Israel launched a surprise attack, do not resume or fail to produce concrete results.

Iran has accused the US of complicity in the Israeli attack, which killed top Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists and hundreds of civilians. The US also launched strikes on three major Iranian nuclear sites, claiming to have “obliterated” them. A ceasefire took effect on June 24.

“If EU/E3 want to have a role, they should act responsibly, and put aside the worn-out policies of threat and pressure, including the ‘snap-back’ for which they lack absolutely moral and legal ground,” Araghchi said last week.

Before the Israel-Iran war, Tehran and Washington held five rounds of nuclear talks mediated by Oman but faced major stumbling blocks such as uranium enrichment in Iran, which Western powers want to bring down to zero to minimise any risk of weaponisation.

Tehran maintains that its nuclear programme is solely meant for civilian purposes.

Middle East assessments

Also on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a surprise meeting in the Kremlin with Ali Larijani, the top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader on nuclear issues.

Larijani “conveyed assessments of the escalating situation in the Middle East and around the Iranian nuclear programme”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the unannounced meeting.

Putin expressed Russia’s “well-known positions on how to stabilise the situation in the region and on the political settlement of the Iranian nuclear programme”, he added.

Moscow has a cordial relationship with Iran’s clerical leadership and provides crucial backing for Tehran, but it did not swing forcefully behind its partner even after the US joined Israel’s bombing campaign.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/20/iran-to-hold-nuclear-talks-with-3-european-powers-on-friday,real

Tsunami threat over after large earthquakes hit Russia’s Pacific coast,"Three earthquakes, one with a magnitude of 7.4, recorded near Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, capital of Russia’s Kamchatka region.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) says there is no longer a danger of tsunami waves on Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula after three earthquakes – the larger with a magnitude of 7.4 – struck in the sea nearby.

The warning was issued earlier on Sunday after the quakes were recorded off the Pacific coast of Russia, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

The epicentres of a series of earthquakes – the others measuring 6.7 and 5 – on Sunday were about 140km (87 miles) east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, capital of Russia’s Kamchatka region, which has a population of more than 160,000.

According to the USGS, the quakes hit the same area off the coast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky within 32 minutes.

The magnitude 7.4 earthquake was at a depth of 20km (12 miles). There were no immediate reports of casualties.

The PTWC initially said there was a danger of major tsunami waves but later downgraded its warning before finally saying the danger had passed.

Russia’s Emergencies Ministry also issued a tsunami warning following the second quake, urging residents of coastal settlements to stay away from the shore.

A separate tsunami watch issued for the state of Hawaii was later lifted.

Germany’s GFZ monitor also confirmed that at least one magnitude 6.7 earthquake was recorded off the east of Kamchatka region on Sunday. GFZ later updated it to magnitude 7.4.

Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky is located in the Kamchatka region, facing the Pacific, northeast of Japan and west of the US state of Alaska, across the Bering Sea.

The Kamchatka Peninsula is the meeting point of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates, making it a seismic hot zone. Since 1900, seven major earthquakes of magnitude 8.3 or higher have struck the area.

Usyk knocks out Dubois to become undisputed heavyweight champion,"Oleksandr Usyk has cemented his status as the outstanding heavyweight of his generation with an emphatic fifth-round knockout of Daniel Dubois in their undisputed world title bout at London’s Wembley Stadium.

Victory on Saturday saw Ukraine’s Usyk extend his unbeaten professional record to 24 fights as the WBA, WBC and WBO champion added his British opponent’s IBF belt to his collection.

Usyk dominated the opening four rounds and early in the fifth, dropped Dubois to the canvas.

Moments later, he finished the fight in decisive fashion after a trademark left hook left his British rival unable to beat the count one minute and 52 seconds into the round.

It was the second time Usyk, at 38, some 11 years older than his opponent, had defeated Dubois after a ninth-round stoppage success in Krakow, Poland, in 2023, where the Briton was ruled to have landed an illegal low blow in the fifth round.

Lennox Lewis, the last British boxer to be the undisputed world champion in 1999, forecast before Saturday’s fight that Usyk would face a vastly-improved Dubois, saying: “Dubois was a baby in the sport and now he’s a man…You’re not going to see the same Daniel Dubois from 18 months ago.”

But after Usyk was roared into the ring by a huge contingent of supporters, many of them waving Ukraine’s national flag in a 90,000 capacity crowd at Wembley, best known as the London base of England’s national football team, it was largely one-way traffic as their hero conducted a ruthless masterclass against local favourite Dubois.

“Thirty-eight is a young guy, remember,” Usyk told DAZN in the ring after dropping to his knees in celebration. “Thirty-eight is only [the] start.

“I want to say thank you to Jesus Christ. I want to say thank you to my team and Wembley, thank you so much! It’s for the people.

“Nothing is next. It’s enough, next, I don’t know. I want to rest. My family, my wife, my children, I want to rest now. Two or three months, I want to just rest.”

Asked about his next opponent, Usyk, who has already twice beaten former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, added: “Maybe it’s Tyson Fury.

“Maybe we have three choices, Derek Chisora and Anthony Joshua. Maybe Joseph Parker. Listen, I cannot now say because I want to go back home.”

Dubois insisted he would return to the ring, saying: “I have to commend him [Usyk] on the performance, I gave everything I had. Take no credit away from that man, I’ll be back.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/7/19/usyk-knocks-out-dubois-to-unify-heavyweight-boxing-belts,real
Zelenskyy says Ukraine sent Russia offer of new peace talks,"Ukraine has proposed to hold a new round of peace talks with Russia next week after negotiations stalled last month.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed on Saturday that Defence Council secretary Rustem Umerov made the offer of a meeting with Russian negotiators for next week.

“Everything should be done to achieve a ceasefire,” Zelenskyy said in his evening address to the nation. “The Russian side should stop hiding from decisions.”

Ukraine’s leader also reiterated his readiness to have a face-to-face sit-down with Putin. “A meeting at the leadership level is needed to truly ensure peace – lasting peace,” he said.

There was no immediate response from Russia.

Ukraine is ready. pic.twitter.com/ksH7FzxnAE — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) July 19, 2025

Umerov, a former defence minister, was appointed last week as the head of the National Security and Defence Council and tasked with adding more momentum to the negotiations.

He headed his country’s delegation in two previous rounds of talks in Turkiye earlier this year, which yielded little more than an agreement to exchange prisoners and soldiers’ remains.

In previous rounds, Russia outlined a list of hardline demands that were not acceptable to Ukraine, calling on it to cede four Ukrainian regions it claims as its own and reject Western military support.

However, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Friday indicated that Moscow agreed with a statement by Zelenskyy that peace efforts needed “more momentum”.

The shift came after United States President Donald Trump, who initially appeared to adopt a conciliatory approach towards Russia after entering office, upped the pressure on Moscow.

This week, Trump set a 50-day deadline for Moscow to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine or face “100 percent tariffs” and the prospect of secondary sanctions being imposed on countries that buy Russian oil.

He also promised to ramp up arms shipments to the war-battered country.

Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on Thursday that Russia would not accept the “blackmail” of Washington’s sanctions ultimatum, and the decision to resume weapons deliveries was a signal to Ukraine to “abandon the peace process”.

Ongoing exchange of fire

Kyiv extended its invitation for more talks with Moscow after Russian forces staged a massive drone attack on the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa early on Saturday, killing at least one resident and injuring six others, according to Zelenskyy.

Posting on X on Saturday, the Ukrainian president said Russia launched more than 30 missiles and 300 drones during its overnight assault that affected 10 regions of the country.

Russia, meanwhile, had to suspend trains for about four hours overnight in the southern Rostov region when it came under a Ukrainian drone attack, which injured one railway worker.

On Saturday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Telegram that Russian air defence systems shot down three drones en route to the city.

Two Moscow airports – Vnukovo and Domodedovo – suspended arrivals and departures for safety reasons, but later resumed operations, Russian aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said.

The Russian Defence Ministry said its air defence systems intercepted and destroyed 27 Ukrainian drones in total from 3pm to 7pm Moscow time (12:00-16:00 GMT).

Protests held across UK supporting banned Palestine Action despite arrests,"Police in the United Kingdom have arrested more than 100 people at protests across the country calling for a ban on campaign group Palestine Action to be reversed.

Demonstrations took place on Saturday in Manchester, Edinburgh, Bristol, Truro and London as part of a campaign coordinated by Defend Our Juries, which has already seen dozens arrested.

London’s Metropolitan police said 55 people were arrested Saturday in Parliament Square for displaying placards in support of Palestine Action. A further eight arrests were made in a separate march in central London in support of the group.

The Met police said 70 people were arrested at similar demonstrations in Parliament Square over the past two weekends.

Greater Manchester Police said it arrested 16 people on suspicion of supporting a proscribed organisation.

Avon and Somerset Police said 17 people were arrested under the Terrorism Act at a demonstration on College Green in Bristol. Devon and Cornwall Police arrested eight people protesting in Truro.

“Just a few weeks ago being arrested under the Terrorism Act was the stuff of nightmares,” said a spokesperson for Defend Our Juries.

“Now it’s a badge of honour that people are wearing with pride – the mark of resistance to genocide and standing firm for our democratic freedoms.”

By the end of the day, a total of 104 people had been detained in connection with the protests, according to figures reported by the UK’s PA news agency. Police warned before the protests that those showing support for the proscribed activist group faced arrest.

The protests come ahead of a High Court hearing on Monday in which the cofounder of Palestine Action, Huda Ammori, will ask for the green light to challenge the home secretary’s decision to ban the group under “anti-terror” laws.

The ban means that membership of, or support for, the direct action group is now a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison, under the Terrorism Act 2000, putting the group on a par with armed groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS).

Authorities have beefed up police presence in Westminster in the wake of the rallies.

The pro-Israeli Stop the Hate group also planned a counter protest in London on Saturday.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said those expressing support for Palestine Action “will likely be committing an offence and will very likely be arrested”.

Five people appeared in court on Saturday over a Palestine Action protest at an Israeli-linked defence firm’s site.

Members of the organisation, allegedly armed with sledgehammers and whips, are accused of breaking into the Elbit Systems site near Patchway, Bristol, in the early hours of August 6, 2024, “counter-terrorism” police said.

More than 2 million pounds of damage ($2.68m) was caused, and police officers and a security guard were assaulted, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.

Prosecutors claim the alleged offences had a “terrorist connection”. The five involved were charged with aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder.

Palestine Action describes itself as “a pro-Palestinian organisation that disrupts the arms industry in the United Kingdom with direct action”.

Since its founding in July 2020, it has carried out hundreds of protests across the UK aimed at disrupting the operations of companies it accuses of profiting from Israeli military assaults, with a particular focus on the Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems.

The group’s tactics typically involve breaking into facilities, chaining themselves to machinery, daubing buildings with red paint and destroying equipment.

The UK has seen hundreds of thousands of people peacefully protest on a near-weekly basis, calling for an end to Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza in the last 22 months.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/19/protests-across-uk-supporting-banned-group-palestine-action-despite-arrests,real
"Genocide or tragedy? Ukraine, Poland at odds over Volyn massacre of 1943","More than 80 years ago, members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army – hailed as heroes for standing up to the Soviet Union – stormed villages and slaughtered tens of thousands of ethnic Poles.

Kyiv, Ukraine – Nadiya escaped the rapists and killers only because her father hid her in a haystack amidst the shooting, shouting and bloodshed that took place 82 years ago.

“He covered me with hay and told me not to get out no matter what,” the 94-year-old woman told Al Jazeera – and asked to withhold her last name and personal details.

On July 11, 1943, members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UIA), a nationalist paramilitary group armed with axes, knives and guns, stormed Nadiya’s village on the Polish-Ukrainian border, killing ethnic Polish men and raping women.

“They also killed anyone who tried to protect the Poles,” Nadiya said.

The nonagenarian is frail and doesn’t go out much, but her face, framed by milky white hair, lights up when she recalls the names and birthdays of her grand- and great-grandchildren.

She also remembers the names of her neighbours who were killed or forced to flee to Poland, even though her parents never spoke about the attack, now known as the Volyn massacre.

“The Soviets forbade it,” Nadiya said, noting how Moscow demonised the UIA, which kept fighting the Soviets until the early 1950s.

Nadiya said her account may enrage today’s Ukrainian nationalists who lionise fighters of the UIA for having championed freedom from Moscow during World War II.

After Communist purges, violent atheism, forced collectivisation and a famine that killed millions of Ukrainians, the UIA leaders chose what they thought was the lesser of two evils. They sided with Nazi Germany, which invaded the USSR in 1941.

Advertisement

In the end, though, the Nazis refused to carve out an independent Ukraine and threw one of the UIA’s leaders, Stepan Bandera, into a concentration camp.

But another UIA leader, Roman Shukhevych, was accused of playing a role in the Holocaust – and in the mass killings of ethnic Poles in what is now the western Ukrainian region of Volyn and adjacent areas in 1943.

Genocide?

Up to 100,000 civilian Poles, including women and children, were stabbed, axed, beaten or burned to death during the Volyn massacre, according to survivors, Polish historians and officials who consider it a “genocide”.

“What’s horrifying isn’t the numbers but the way the murders were carried out,” Robert Derevenda of the Polish Institute of National Memory told Polskie Radio on July 11.

This year, the Polish parliament decreed July 11 as “The Volyn Massacre Day” in remembrance of the 1943 killings.

“A martyr’s death for just being Polish deserves to be commemorated,” the bill said.

“From Poland’s viewpoint, yes, this is a tragedy of the Polish people, and Poland is fully entitled to commemorate it,” Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevych told Al Jazeera.

However, rightist Polish politicians may use the day to promote anti-Ukrainian narratives, and a harsh response from Kyiv may further trigger tensions, he said.

“All of these processes ideally should be a matter of discussion among historians, not politicians,” he added.

Ukrainian politicians and historians, meanwhile, call the Volyn massacre a “tragedy”. They cite a lower death toll and accuse the Polish army of the reciprocal killing of tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians.

In post-Soviet Ukraine, UIA leaders Bandera and Shukhevych have often been hailed as national heroes, and hundreds of streets, city squares and other landmarks are named after them.

Evolving views and politics

“[The USSR] branded ‘Banderite’ any proponent of Ukraine’s independence or even any average person who stood for the legitimacy of public representation of Ukrainian culture,” Kyiv-based human rights advocate Vyacheslav Likhachyov told Al Jazeera.

The demonisation backfired when many advocates of Ukraine’s independence began to sympathise with Bandera and the UIA, “turning a blind eye to their radicalism, xenophobia and political violence”, he said.

Advertisement

In the 2000s, anti-Russian Ukrainian leaders began to celebrate the UIA, despite objections from many Ukrainians, especially in the eastern and southern regions.

These days, the UIA is seen through a somewhat myopic prism of Ukraine’s ongoing war with Russia, according to Likhachyov.

Ukraine’s political establishment sees the Volyn massacre and armed skirmishes between Ukrainians and Poles as only “a war related to the Ukrainians’ ‘fight for their land’”, according to Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher at Bremen University in Germany.

“And during a war, they say, anything happens, and a village, where the majority is on the enemy’s side, is considered a ‘legitimate target’,” he explained.

Many right-leaning Ukrainian youngsters “fully accepted” Bandera’s radicalism and the cult of militant nationalism, he said.

Before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, thousands of far-right nationalists rallied throughout Ukraine to commemorate Bandera’s January 1 birthday.

“Bandera is our father, Ukraine is our mother,” they chanted.

Within hours, the Polish and Israeli embassies issued declarations in protest, reminding them of the UIA’s role in the Holocaust and the Volyn massacre.

Far-right activists began volunteering to fight Moscow-backed separatists in southeastern Ukraine in 2014 and enlisted in droves in 2022.

“In the situational threat to [Ukraine’s] very existence, there’s no room for reflection and self-analysis,” rights advocate Likhachyov said.

Warsaw, meanwhile, will keep using the Volyn massacre to make demands for concessions while threatening to oppose Ukraine’s integration into the European Union, he said.

As for Moscow, it “traditionally plays” the dispute to sow discord between Kyiv and Warsaw, analyst Tyshkevych said, and to accuse Ukrainian leaders of “neo-Nazi” proclivities.

Is reconciliation possible?

Today, memories of the Volyn massacre remain deeply contested. For many Ukrainians, the UIA’s image as freedom fighters has been bolstered by Russia’s 2022 invasion, somewhat pushing aside reflection on the group’s role in the World War II atrocities.

For Poland, commemoration of the massacre has become a marker of national trauma and, at times, a point of leverage in political disputes with Ukraine.

In April, Polish experts began exhuming the remnants of the Volyn massacre victims in the western Ukrainian village of Puzhniky after Kyiv lifted a seven-year moratorium on such exhumations. Some believe this may be a first step in overcoming the tensions over the Volyn massacre.

Reconciliation, historians say, won’t come easily.

“The way to reconciliation is often painful and requires people to accept historical realities they’re uncomfortable with,” Ivar Dale, a senior policy adviser with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a human rights watchdog, told Al Jazeera.

UK sanctions senior Russian intelligence officers over cyberattacks,"The UK sanctions three units of the Russian military intelligence GRU agency and 18 of its officers.

The United Kingdom says it has sanctioned more than 20 Russian spies, hackers and agencies over what it called a “sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity” to destabilise Europe.

The Foreign Office said on Friday it was sanctioning three units of the Russian military intelligence GRU agency and 18 of its officers.

Those sanctioned include officers it said were involved in preparing the attack against Ukraine’s Mariupol theatre in the first month of the war in 2022, which killed hundreds of civilians of taking shelter inside the building.

It also sanctioned those it accuses of involvement in targeting former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were the victims of a nerve agent Novichok poisoning attack in 2018 in the UK.

“GRU spies are running a campaign to destabilise Europe, undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and threaten the safety of British citizens,” Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement.

The UK also said Russia had targeted media outlets, telecoms providers, political and democratic institutions, and energy infrastructure in the UK.

British authorities have repeatedly accused Moscow of orchestrating malign activity, ranging from traditional espionage and actions to undermine democracy, to sabotage and assassinations.

Russia denies claims

Earlier this month, three men were convicted over an arson attack on a Ukrainian-linked business in London that police said was carried out at the behest of the Wagner mercenary group.

Moscow has rejected such accusations, saying they were politically motivated and that it posed no threat to the UK.

In addition to the sanctions aimed at GRU, the British foreign ministry said it was sanctioning three leaders of the “African Initiative,” which it said was a Russian-funded social media content mill conducting information operations in West Africa.

The UK has recently ramped up its military spending to help change its approach to defence, partly to address threats from Russia, nuclear risks and cyberattacks.

The European Union and NATO also issued statements on Friday condemning what they described as Russia’s destabilising hybrid activities.

The UK move came on the same day the EU approved a new host of stiff sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine.

The EU sanctions package includes a lower oil price cap, a ban on transactions with Nord Stream gas pipelines, and the targeting of more shadow fleet ships.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/uk-sanctions-senior-russian-intelligence-officers-over-cyberattacks,real
Snoop Dogg becomes Swansea City co-owner in rivalry with Wrexham,"American rapper and artist Snoop Dogg has become co-owner of Wrexham’s rivals Swansea City in the English Championship.

Snoop Dogg has become co-owner of English Championship side Swansea City in an unlikely alliance between the world of rap and football, the Welsh club announced.

The 53-year-old American star joins former Real Madrid stalwart and Croatia World Cup finalist Luka Modric in the club’s ownership structure.

Snoop Dogg made a surprise appearance on the club’s social media channels last week, modelling their new home jersey for the 2025-26 season, and the club announced on Thursday that he has become an investor.

Swansea’s Welsh rivals Wrexham have achieved a meteoric rise to the championship – the second-tier of English football – since Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought the club in 2020.

Snoop Dogg’s Swansea involvement comes after American businessmen Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen took over the club last November.

Swansea will hope that Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, can use his 100 million-plus social media followers to boost the club’s profile as they seek to return to the Premier League for the first time since they were relegated in 2018.

Swansea’s owners have said they want to generate greater revenue, which would allow them to invest more in new players under the profit and sustainability rules in British football.

The 53-year-old rapper said on the club’s website: “My love of football is well known, but it feels special to me that I make my move into club ownership with Swansea City.

“The story of the club and the area really struck a chord with me. This is a proud, working-class city and club. An underdog that bites back, just like me.

“I’m proud to be part of Swansea City.”

Swansea announced in April that Modric, who this week joined AC Milan at the age of 39 after leaving Real Madrid, had acquired a stake in the club.

“To borrow a phrase from Snoop’s back catalogue, this announcement is the next episode for Swansea City as we seek to create new opportunities to boost the club’s reach and profile,” Swansea’s owners said in a statement.

“Snoop’s colossal global fanbase and audience will certainly help us do that, and he has made clear to us throughout this process just how excited he is at the prospect of joining the club.”

“Snoop has openly shared his love of football and his desire to be involved in the game, and we expect his involvement to support us putting as competitive a team as possible out on the field.”

Wrexham targets Premier League through playoffs

Meanwhile, the Hollywood fairy tale that is Wrexham AFC is only just beginning, the club’s chief executive said on Friday as the Welsh side continued its unlikely quest to crack the English Premier League.

Since Reynolds and McElhenney bought the Welsh club in 2020, Wrexham has become the first team to earn three successive promotions from England’s National League to the second-tier championship.

Wrexham will play relegated former Premier League club Southampton in their championship opener on August 9, a prospect club chief executive Michael Williamson described as a “pinch yourself” moment.

Williamson, speaking in Wellington during the club’s preseason tour to Australia and New Zealand, said success was more than simply making up the numbers.

“The expectation is, and Rob McElhenney will say that he doesn’t know what this word is, but obviously we need to consolidate our position in the championship,” Williamson said.

“If we are able to find ourselves halfway through the season, in December, in that 3-4-5-6-7 position, people should be worried about us.

“Because I believe if we make the playoffs with the type of mentality that we have, anything can happen in 90 minutes.

“I really would give ourselves a strong shot of giving it a run.”

The Welsh minnows languished for years in the lower tiers of English football before being bought by Reynolds and McElhenney, and shooting to fame through the Welcome to Wrexham documentary.

They return to the championship for the first time in more than 40 years.

The fighting words were echoed by former Wrexham player-turned-club ambassador, Ben Tozer, who was also in New Zealand for the tour.

“It’s a massive challenge, don’t get me wrong,” Tozer said.

“But the momentum of our club, four years of pure success and heading in the right direction, winning a lot more games than losing. We could surprise some people.”

Fellow club ambassador, former Wrexham and Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster, said the club had set itself apart by recruiting the right people.

“If you look at it in the cold light of day, the stark reality is that money is going to start playing a massive role now,” Foster said.

“When you’ve got players and clubs that have just been relegated from the Premier League, they’re on big wages and they’re big players and they’re worth big money because they are of a calibre of player.

“But I’d like to think Wrexham can do it in a slightly different way where we identify the people, and the team is more important than the individuals.”

Foster lauded a “no d********” policy at the club, which meant players and staff were working towards a common goal.

Chief executive Williamson said the policy started in the dressing room and was led by manager Phil Parkinson.

Over the past year, Wrexham’s staff numbers had grown by more than 60, to about 105.

“I would say most of the 60 or so employees that have been hired, I’ve personally interviewed at some point,” Williamson said.

“For me, it was important to bring in, especially on the senior leadership side, people who understood what Wrexham is and what we’re actually doing here. We’re not just another football club.

“There are people who had incredible CVs, experience. You look at them and say, ‘Wow, you think that they would be incredible for Wrexham.’

“And then you go through the interview process and realise that they’re not really understanding what Wrexham is as a town, as a community, as a club.

“That’s something that took a lot of effort. We’re trying to create a culture within the club.”

Wrexham will return to Wales on Sunday, after playing Wellington Phoenix in New Zealand on Saturday evening.

Parkinson confirmed the club was close to signing New Zealand international left back Liberato Cacace – a former Wellington Phoenix junior player – from Italian club Empoli.

TSC announces retraining of senior school teachers in Competency-Based Education,"The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has announced a nationwide retooling exercise for senior school teachers as part of preparations for the rollout of Competency-Based Education (CBE) under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC).





The face-to-face training is scheduled to take place from 28th July to 15th August 2025 at selected or procured venues across various counties.





According to an internal memo addressed to Regional and County Directors, the initiative targets teachers currently serving in regular secondary schools, Special Needs Education (SNE) institutions, and vocational training centres.





""The County Directors will be required to select teachers for retooling and trainers of Teachers,"" the Memo reads in part.





The retooling programme will focus on aligning teachers with the new senior school pathways introduced under CBC. Participants will be clustered into three broad learning areas:





Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) – covering pure sciences, applied sciences, and technical subjects.

Social Sciences – including languages, humanities, and business studies.

Arts and Sports Science – encompassing music, visual and performing arts, and physical education.

The Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) senior school rollout, covering Grades 10-12, is scheduled to begin in January 2026.





TSC has outlined that the selection of teachers for this training will be based on the number of teachers currently on duty in each school and institution.





The retooling exercise is a critical component in ensuring that teachers are adequately equipped with the skills and knowledge required to effectively deliver the CBC framework in senior secondary schools.





The curriculum emphasizes hands-on learning, creativity, critical thinking, and the nurturing of learners’ talents across diverse academic and co-curricular disciplines.





The CBC has already been implemented at the pre-primary, primary, and junior secondary levels with the retooling of senior school teachers marking the final phase of its rollout, as the first CBC cohort transitions to senior secondary in January 2026.",https://www.citizen.digital/news/tsc-announces-retraining-of-senior-school-teachers-in-competency-based-education-n366532,real
